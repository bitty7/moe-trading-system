If you’re hosting a celebration for the holiday, you might be wondering how you’re going to get everything together — along with how much it will all cost.\nCheck Out: 10 Best Spring Items To Buy at Costco Before They Sell Out\nFor You: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nDecorations, food, candy and more can add up, so here are some solid tips on how to keep Easter party costs down without putting all your savings eggs in one basket.\nDon’t Buy Premade Easter Baskets\nIt might seem quick and easy to buy Easter baskets that have already been filled with candy and goodies, but the truth is you can do that yourself for way less cash. Stop by your nearest dollar store or local craft shop and pick up baskets (or if you can find any around the house, that’s even better). Fill them with dollar store candy and treats and you’ll save on trying to buy premium options.\nRemember, if it’s premade, you’re paying extra for that convenience. Save yourself some cash and do it yourself if you have the time. You can even add a little customized touch that will make the baskets special and feel more personal to those you gift them.\nExplore More: 7 Best Home Items To Buy at Dollar Tree in April\nMake Your Own Egg Dye\nIf you’re planning on having an egg painting station at your Easter celebration, this tip is crucial. Going back to the convenience cost, if you buy an egg dye kit, you’re paying for the convenience. \nYou can easily make lots of dye yourself for less. All you need is equal parts vinegar, food coloring and water. Make sure to also throw down some paper or a plastic tablecloth as the coloring fun can get a little messy.\nAsk Guests To Bring Dishes\nJust because you’re hosting doesn’t mean you need to make every course of the Easter meal. Ask guests if they wouldn’t mind bringing appetizers, drinks, desserts and sides to enjoy more of a potluck-style event. \nThis way, you can focus on the main course and don’t have to worry about purchasing everything else. Plus, guests are sure to bring something they like, so the pressure is off to satisfy everybody. \nMake Your Own Decorations\nYou probably have some craft supplies around the house that you can turn into colorful Easter decorations. If you don’t, you can quickly pick up some construction paper, glitter and glue from the dollar store. Not only is this a great way to save money, but also serves as a fun activity for the whole family.\nPinterest is a great resource for cheap and quick crafts you can make by yourself that won’t cost as much as ones that are pre-assembled. There are also tons of free printables online that you can easily print off at home and hang around your house. \nVisit the Thrift Store for Clothes\nThe perfect Easter dress for your daughter might be something you’re looking for at high-end department stores and sites, but it’s more affordable to shop for something secondhand. Chances are, your growing child won’t fit into it next year, so you’ll spend a lot of money for just one wear.\nVisit local thrift stores or eBay to browse gently worn clothing that will look absolutely great and save you cash at the same time.\nShop Smart for Flowers\nFlowers are essential to create the spring atmosphere Easter calls for, but paying for a full flower arrangement is incredibly expensive. Instead, make your arrangements from grocery store flowers that cost a fraction of the price of ordering from a florist.\nCarnations from the store or picking wild flowers are one of the cheaper options and look beautiful, so keep that in mind when you’re looking for deals. You can use vases and glasses you have at home and spread the flowers throughout the house.

All you have to do, if you want to become a millionaire, if you want $10 million a year or $100 million or you want to become a billionaire, they’ll all tell you this, every person that has ever done money right: It all comes down to you wanting to.”\nUp Next: How Much Is Vice President JD Vance Worth?

You just put in your desired income, what you’re currently earning — either because you sell something or you provide a service or somebody pays you — and then it’s going to start doing the math for you: how many customers [you need], how many products you need to sell, etc., and then provide you with some solutions.

{"Date":"2025-04-23","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/food-stamps-4-major-changes-snap-2025","Article":"SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is the largest federal nutrition assistance program. It provides benefits to eligible low-income individuals and families via an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) oversees SNAP, and according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), the program improves food security, offers benefits that enable families to purchase healthier diets, and frees up resources that can be used for health-promoting activities and needed medical care.\nFind Out: You Might Not Make Enough Money To Get Musk’s Potential DOGE Dividend Check — Here’s the Salary Cutoff\nTrending Now: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\n“SNAP reduces the overall prevalence of food insecurity by as much as 30% and is even more effective among children and those with [children],” the CBPP notes.\nThe USDA adjusts SNAP maximum allotments, deductions and income eligibility standards at the beginning of each federal fiscal year. The fiscal year for 2025 began on Oct. 1, 2024, and the changes are based on adjustments to the cost of living — the amount of money needed to support a basic standard of living, according to the department.\nHere are some of the major changes to SNAP so you can plan accordingly this year.\nEligibility and Age\nIn order to receive SNAP benefits, there are rules of eligibility based on age. The USDA gradually increases the age of what it calls “able-bodied adults without dependents” (ABAWD) and adds new groups of individuals who are exempt from the ABAWD work requirements.\nLast year, ABAWDs aged 18 to 50 had work requirements, which included working at least 80 hours a month, participating in a work program at least 80 hours a month, or participating in a combination of work and work program hours for a total of at least 80 hours a month.\nIn 2025, these work requirements expanded to age 52, and requirements will expand to age 54 as of October 2024, according to the USDA.\nHowever, there are some exemptions to the ABAWD work requirements. For instance, you are excused if you are unable to work due to a physical or mental limitation, if you are pregnant, if you are a veteran, are homeless, or age 24 or younger and in foster care on your 18th birthday.\nLearn More: The Living Wage a Family of 4 Needs in All 50 States\nIncome Eligibility\nYou are eligible for SNAP benefits if you do not exceed the following gross monthly income limit — 130% of the federal poverty level. If you are applying for SNAP or curious if you have SNAP eligibility, here are a few key takeaways for 2025:\nFor fiscal year 2025, the FNS increased maximum allotments and shelter caps for most U.S. states and territories. The COLA (cost-of-living adjustment) allotments came into effect on Oct. 1, 2024.\nThe maximum allotments will increase for the 48 states and Washington D.C., Alaska, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nThe maximum allotment for a family of four in the 48 states and D.C., will be $975, but the maximum allotment for a family of four in Hawaii will decrease to $1,723.\nMaximum allotments for a family of four will range from $1,258 to $1,953 in Alaska. \nThe maximum allotment for a family of four will be $1,437 in Guam and $1,254 in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nThe minimum benefit for the 48 states and D.C. will remain the same at $23. The minimum monthly payment in Alaska ranges from $30 to $47, while in Hawaii it is $41.\nMaximum Allotments\nThough receiving benefits is often based on your net income, which means gross income minus allowable deductions, the amount of SNAP household benefits can vary by location and family size. It’s also important to factor in that the COLA for Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits was 2.5% in 2025.\nHere are the maximum allotments for SNAP in the 48 contiguous states and D.C., according to the USDA website:\nHousehold size 1: $292\nHousehold size 2: $536\nHousehold size 3: $768\nHousehold size 4: $975\nHousehold size 5: $1,158\nHousehold size 6: $1,390\nHousehold size 7: $1,536\nHousehold size 8: $1,756\nEach additional person: $220\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Used Luxury SUVs That Are a Good Investment for Retirees\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n7 Overpriced Grocery Items Frugal People Should Quit Buying in 2025\n4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Food Stamps: 4 Major Changes to SNAP in 2025\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

CLX is expected to announce its fiscal Q3 2025 earnings results after the market closes on Monday, May 5. \nAhead of this event, analysts expect the consumer products maker to report a profit of $1.57 per share, down 8.2% from $1.71 per share in the year-ago quarter. However, the company has surpassed Wall Street's earnings estimates in the last four quarters. In Q2 2025, CLX beat the consensus EPS estimate by 11.5%.\nMore Top Stocks Daily: Go behind Wall Street’s hottest headlines with Barchart’s Active Investor newsletter.\n For fiscal 2025, analysts expect CLX to report an EPS of $7.18, up 16.4% from $6.17 in fiscal 2024.  \nwww.barchart.com\nShares of CLX have declined 2.3% over the past 52 weeks, lagging behind both the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) nearly 6% rise and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLP) 12.1% return over the same period. \nwww.barchart.com\nDespite Clorox reporting better-than-expected Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.55 and revenue of $1.69 billion on Feb. 3, shares dropped 7.2% the next day. Net sales fell 15% year-over-year, compared to a 16% increase in the same quarter last year, largely due to the impact of post-cyberattack inventory normalization and the divestiture of its vitamins, minerals & supplements (VMS) and Argentina businesses. While organic sales guidance was raised to 4% - 7%, overall fiscal 2025 net sales are still expected to be flat to up just 2%.\nAnalysts' consensus view on Clorox’s stock is cautious, with a \"Hold\" rating overall. Among 17 analysts covering the stock, one recommends \"Strong Buy,\" 12 suggest \"Hold,\" and four advise \"Strong Sell.\" As of writing, CLX is trading below the average analyst price target of $154.38. \nOn the date of publication, Sohini Mondal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

{"Date":"2025-04-21","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/warm-us-spring-temps-weigh-nat-gas-prices","Article":"May Nymex natural gas (NGK25) on Thursday closed down by -0.002 (-0.06%).\nMay nat-gas prices on Thursday fell to a 2-1\/2 month low and settled slightly lower.  On Thursday, nat-gas prices were under pressure on forecasts for warm spring US temperatures that will curb heating demand and allow nat-gas inventories to rebuild.  Forecaster Atmospheric G2 said Thursday that forecasts shifted warmer for the eastern two-thirds of the US for April 22-26.  However,  short covering emerged in nat-gas futures Thursday, and prices recovered almost all of their losses after weekly EIA nat-gas inventories rose +16 bcf, below expectations of+24 bcf.  \nDon’t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart’s best-in-class commodity analysis.\n Last month, nat-gas rallied to a 2-year high on signs that US nat-gas storage levels could remain tight ahead of the summer air-conditioning season.  BloombergNEF projects that US gas storage will be 10% below the five-year average this summer.\nLower-48 state dry gas production Thursday was 105.6  bcf\/day (+5.4 y\/y), according to BNEF.  Lower-48 state gas demand Thursday was 70.1 bcf\/day (+2.2% y\/y), according to BNEF.  LNG net flows to US LNG export terminals Thursday were 15.5 bcf\/day (-4.8% w\/w), according to BNEF.\nAn increase in US electricity output is positive for nat-gas demand from utility providers.  The Edison Electric Institute reported Wednesday that total US (lower-48) electricity output in the week ended April 12 rose +6.4% y\/y to 73,420 GWh (gigawatt hours), and US electricity output in the 52-week period ending April 12 rose +3.7% y\/y to 4,247,718 GWh.\nIn a bullish longer-term factor for nat-gas prices, President Trump lifted the Biden administration's pause on approving gas export projects in January, thus moving into active consideration a backlog of about a dozen LNG export projects.  Increased US capacity for exporting LNG would boost demand for US nat-gas and support nat-gas prices.\nThursday's weekly EIA report was bullish for nat-gas prices since nat-gas inventories for the week ended April 11 rose +16 bcf, below expectations of +24 bcf and below the 5-year average draw for this time of year of +50 bcf.  As of April 11, nat-gas inventories were down -20.9% y\/y and -3.9% below their 5-year seasonal average, signaling tight nat-gas supplies.  In Europe, gas storage was 36% full as of April 15, versus the 5-year seasonal average of 47% full for this time of year.\nBaker Hughes reported Thursday that the number of active US nat-gas drilling rigs in the week ending April 18 rose +1 to 98 rigs, modestly above the 3-1\/2 year low of 94 rigs posted on September 6, 2024.  Active rigs have fallen since posting a 5-1\/4 year high of 166 rigs in Sep 2022, up from the pandemic-era record low of 68 rigs posted in July 2020 (data since 1987). \nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

{"Date":"2025-04-21","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/stocks-settle-mixed-energy-producers-rally-and-health-insurers-fall","Article":"The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) Thursday closed up +0.13%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -1.33%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed unchanged.  June E-mini S&P futures (ESM25) are up +0.19%, and June E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQM25) are up +0.10%. \nStock indexes on Thursday settled mixed.  Stocks found some support Thursday on positive signals from initial US-Japan trade talks that spurred hopes that trade agreements can be reached with US trading partners.  President Trump said late Wednesday that there was \"big progress\" in talks to strike a deal for Japan and expressed confidence that the US would reach a trade deal with the EU.  Strength in energy stocks led gains in the broader market on Thursday after WTI crude oil rallied more than +3% to a 1-1\/2 week high.\nJoin 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n Stocks also garnered support Thursday after US weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell to a 2-month low.  Other US economic news was mixed as housing starts fell, but building permits rose, and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey fell to a 2-year low.\nThursday's weakness in health insurance companies weighed on the Dow Jones Industrials and limited gains in the overall market.  Health insurance stocks were under pressure as UnitedHealth Group slumped more than -22% after cutting its full-year earnings outlook.  Also, chip stocks fell for a second day Thursday, led by a -2% fall in Nvidia to add to Wednesday's -6% slump after the US government barred the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips to China.\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell -9,000 to a 2-month low of 215,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 225,000.\nUS March housing starts fell -11.4% m\/m to 1.324 million, weaker than expectations of 1.420 million.  However, March building permits, a proxy for future construction, unexpectedly rose +1.6% m\/m to 1.482 million, stronger than expectations of a decline to 1.450 million.\nThe US Apr Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey plunged -38.9 to a 2-year low of -26.4, weaker than expectations of 2.2.\nNew York Fed President Williams said the US economy is in a very good place, and he doesn't see the need to change the fed funds rate anytime soon.\nThe markets are discounting the chances at 11% for a -25 bp rate cut after the May 6-7 FOMC meeting.\nQ1 earnings reporting season began last Friday as big US banks reported their results.  According to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence, the market consensus is for Q1 year-over-year earnings growth of +6.7% for the S&P 500 stocks, down from expectations of +11.1% in early November.  Full-year 2025 corporate profits for the S&P 500 are seen rising +9.4%, down from the forecast of +12.5% in early January. \nOverseas stock markets on Thursday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.63%.  China's Shanghai Composite climbed to a 2-week high and closed up +0.13%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +1.35%.\nAs a summary of recent tariff developments, President Trump last Friday said he would temporarily exempt consumer electronics from reciprocal tariffs and the baseline 10% global tariffs.  However, a 20% tariff still applies to electronics shipped from China.  Last Wednesday, President Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs on 56 nations but left the new 10% baseline tariff on virtually all nations in place.  Meanwhile, the EU last Thursday said it will delay for 90 days the implementation of 25% tariffs on 21 billion euros worth of US goods sent to Europe.\nOn March 4, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and doubled the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% from 10%.  On April 2, President Trump signed a proclamation to implement a 25% tariff on US auto imports.  The tariffs will initially target vehicles fully assembled outside the US and, by May 3, will expand to include automobile parts made outside the US.  On April 5, a 10% baseline tariff for virtually all nations took effect. \nLast Friday, China raised tariffs on all US goods to 125% from 84% in retaliation for the US raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. Tit-for-tat retaliation worsened US-China trade tensions after China on Tuesday ordered its airlines not to take any further deliveries of Boeing's jets, and the US government barred Nvidia from selling its H20 chips to China on Wednesday.\nInterest Rates\nJune 10-year T-notes (ZNM25) Thursday closed down -8 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +4.8 bp to 4.325%.  June T-notes posted moderate losses Thursday on reduced safe-haven demand on hopes that trade agreements can be reached with US trading partners.  President Trump said there was \"big progress\" in talks to strike a deal for Japan, and he expressed confidence that the US would reach a trade deal with the EU.  T-notes were also under pressure from Wednesday when Fed Chair Powell warned that trade tensions could spur inflation and slow growth, and that the Fed was in no hurry to cut interest rates.  Losses in T-notes were limited due to carryover support from a rally in European government bonds after the ECB cut interest rates.\nEuropean bond yields on Thursday moved lower.  The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1-1\/2 week low of 2.452% and finished down -3.7 bp to 2.472%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-1\/2 week low of 4.547% and finished down -3.7 bp to 4.566%.\nGerman Mar PPI fell -0.2% y\/y, weaker than expectations of +0.4% y\/y and the biggest decline in 5 months.\nAs expected, the ECB cut the deposit facility rate by -25 bp to 2.25% from 2.50% on Thursday.  The post-meeting statement dropped the word \"restrictive\" to describe monetary policy and said, \"The Eurozone economy has been building up some resilience against global shocks, but the outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions.\"\nECB President Lagarde said downside risks to economic growth have increased, and most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 92% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the June 5 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nEnergy producers rallied Thursday after the price of WTI crude jumped more than +3% to a 1-1\/2 week high.  Diamondback Energy (FANG) closed up more than +5% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100.  Also, APA Corp (APA) and Haliburton (HAL) closed up more than +4%, and Conoco Phillips (COP), Devon Energy (DVN), and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) closed up more than +3%.  In addition, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX), Valero Energy (VLO), and Schlumberger (SLB) closed up more than +2%.\nHealth insurance stocks sold off Thursday, led by a -22% slump in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) after cutting its full-year earnings outlook to $26.00-$26.50 from $29.50-$30.00, well below the consensus of $29.73.  Also, Humana (HUM) closed down more than -7%, and Molina Healthcare (MOH) closed down more than -3%.  In addition, Elevance Health (ELV), CVS Health (CVS), and Centene (CNC) closed down more than -2%. \nThursday's weakness in chip stocks was a drag on the overall market. Nvidia (NVDA), Lam Research (LRCX), and Broadcom (AVGO) closed down more than -2%.  Also, Intel (INTC) and LA Corp (KLAC) closed down more than -1%.  In addition, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed down -0.89%, and Micron Technology (MU) closed down -0.76%. \nEli Lilly (LLY) closed up more than +14% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 after saying a late-stage trial of its oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron, met key efficacy goals and could become the first approved oral diabetes and weight-loss treatment.\nFidelity National Information (FIS) closed up more than +8% after selling its stake in Worldpay to Global Payments for $6.6 billion.\nNike (NKE) closed up more than +4% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones Industrials after Jeffries said the stock should \"aggressively\" be bought at these levels with a price target of $115.\nTrade Desk (TTD) closed up more than +3% after a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized online advertising markets for advertising exchanges and tools used by websites to sell ad space.\nHuntington Bancshares (HBAN) closed up more than +2% after reporting Q1 net interest margin of 3.10%, above the consensus of 2.97%.\nHB Fuller (FUL) closed up more than +2% after Baird upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral with a price target of $60. \nGlobal Payments (GPN) closed down more than -17% after acquiring Worldpay for $24.3 billion.\nQXO Inc (QXO) closed down more than -8% after announcing it intends to offer $500 million of shares of its common stock. \nSnap-on Inc (SNA) closed down -8% after reporting Q1 net sales of $1.14 billion, weaker than the consensus of $1.20 billion.\nAlcoa (AA) closed down more than -7% after saying the 25% tariff on metal imports has already cost it $20 million since the tariffs went into effect.\nAngloGold Ashanti Plc (AU) closed down more than -5% after HSBC downgraded the stock to reduce from hold with a price target of $35.\nEarnings Reports (4\/21\/2025)\nAGNC Investment Corp (AGNC), BOK Financial Corp (BOKF), Comerica Inc (CMA), Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc (ELS), Hexcel Corp (HXL), Medpace Holdings Inc (MEDP), W R Berkley Corp (WRB), Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL), Wintrust Financial Corp (WTFC), Zions Bancorp NA (ZION).\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

{"Date":"2025-04-21","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/coffee-prices-settle-lower-dollar-strength-and-higher-inventories","Article":"May arabica coffee (KCK25) Thursday closed down -0.55 (-0.15%), and May ICE robusta coffee (RMK25) closed down -135 (-2.51%).\nCoffee prices on Thursday settled lower and came under pressure from a stronger dollar (DXY00).  An increase in current coffee supplies also weighed on prices after ICE-monitored arabica coffee inventories rose to a 1-month high Thursday of 795,588 bags, and ICE-monitored robusta coffee inventories rose to a 1-week high of 4,272 lots.\nDon’t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart’s best-in-class commodity analysis.\n Coffee prices have been moving higher this week, with arabica coffee posting a 1-1\/2 week high today and robusta posting a 2-1\/2 week high on Wednesday.  Coffee prices are climbing as below-normal rain in Brazil may hurt coffee yields.  Somar Meteorologia reported Monday that Brazil's biggest arabica coffee growing area of Minas Gerais received 17.9 mm of rain in the week ended April 12, or 89% of the historical average.\nSupply fears are supportive of coffee prices.  Cecafe reported last Wednesday that Brazil's March green coffee exports fell -26% y\/y to 2.95 million bags.  On January 28, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, forecasted that Brazil's 2025\/26 coffee crop would fall -4.4% y\/y to a 3-year low of 51.81 million bags.  Conab also cut its 2024 Brazil coffee crop estimate by -1.1% to 54.2 million bags from a September estimate of 54.8 million bags.  \nCoffee also has support after Cooxupe, Brazil's largest arabica coffee co-operative, said high temperatures and below-normal rainfall last month in Brazil would negatively affect coffee yields this year.  Brazil is the world's largest producer of arabica coffee.  \nLast Wednesday, arabica coffee fell to a 3-month low as global trade war fears undercut most commodity prices, including coffee.  Also, there is concern that coffee demand will suffer as the higher tariffs increase coffee prices for US consumers.  \nOn the negative side for coffee, Marex Solutions said on March 7 that they expect the global coffee surplus in the 2025\/26 season to widen to 1.2 million bags from +200,000 bags in the 2024\/25 season.\nIncreased global supplies are bearish for robusta coffee.  Marex Solutions projects Vietnam's 2025\/26 robusta production at 28.8 million bags, up +7.9% y\/y, and Brazil's 2025\/26 robusta production at 25 million bags, up +13.6% y\/y.\nThe impact of dry El Nino weather last year may lead to longer-term coffee crop damage in South and Central America.  Rainfall in Brazil has consistently been below average since last April, damaging coffee trees during the all-important flowering stage and reducing the prospects for Brazil's 2025\/26 arabica coffee crop.  Brazil has been facing the driest weather since 1981, according to the natural disaster monitoring center Cemaden.  Also, Colombia, the world's second-largest arabica producer, is slowly recovering from the El Nino-spurred drought last year.\nRobusta coffee has support from reduced robusta production.  Due to drought, Vietnam's coffee production in the 2023\/24 crop year dropped by -20% to 1.472 MMT, the smallest crop in four years.  Also, Vietnam's General Statistics Office reported that 2024 Vietnam coffee exports fell -17.1% y\/y to 1.35 MMT.  In addition, the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association on March 12 cut its 2024\/25 Vietnam coffee production estimate to 26.5 million bags from a December estimate of 28 million bags.  Finally, the Vietnam Customs Department reported Friday that Vietnam's Jan-March coffee exports were down -15.3% y\/y to 495,780 MT.  Vietnam is the world's largest robusta coffee producer.\nNews of larger global coffee exports is bearish for prices.  Conab reported on February 4 that Brazil's 2024 coffee exports rose +28.8% y\/y to a record 50.5 million bags.  However, ICO reported on February 6 that Dec global coffee exports fell -12.4% y\/y to 10.73 million bags, and Oct-Dec global coffee exports fell -0.8% y\/y to 32.25 million bags.\nThe USDA's biannual report on December 18 was mixed for coffee prices.  The USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) projected that world coffee production in 2024\/25 will increase +4.0% y\/y to 174.855 million bags, with a +1.5% increase in arabica production to 97.845 million bags and a +7.5% increase in robusta production to 77.01 million bags.  The USDA's FAS forecasts that 2024\/25 ending stocks will fall by -6.6% to a 25-year low of 20.867 million bags from 22.347 million bags in 2023\/24.  Separately, the USDA's FAS on November 22 projected Brazil's 2024\/25 coffee production at 66.4 MMT, below its previous forecast of 69.9 MMT.  The USDA's FAS projects Brazil's coffee inventories at 1.2 million bags at the end of the 2024\/25 season in June, down -26% y\/y.\nFor the 2025\/26 marketing year, Volcafe on December 17 cut its 2025\/26 Brazil arabica coffee production estimate to 34.4 million bags, down by about 11 million bags from a September estimate after a crop tour revealed the severity of an extended drought in Brazil.  Volcafe projects a global 2025\/26 arabica coffee deficit of -8.5 million bags, wider than the -5.5 million bag deficit for 2024\/25 and the fifth consecutive year of deficits. \nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The dollar found support Thursday due to some optimism about US trade talks after President Trump said US negotiators made “big progress” with Japanese officials on a trade deal and expressed confidence that the US would reach a trade deal with the EU.  The dollar also rose after US weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell to a 2-month low, a sign of labor market strength, and New York Fed President Williams said the US economy is in a very good place.  Gains in the dollar were limited after Mar housing starts fell more than expected, and the Apr Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey fell to a 2-year low.  Also, strength in stocks curbed liquidity demand for the dollar.\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims unexpectedly fell -9,000 to a 2-month low of 215,000, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of an increase to 225,000.\nJoin 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n US March housing starts fell -11.4% m\/m to 1.324 million, weaker than expectations of 1.420 million. However, March building permits, a proxy for future construction, unexpectedly rose +1.6% m\/m to 1.482 million, stronger than expectations of a decline to 1.450 million.\nThe US Apr Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey plunged by -38.9 points to a 2-year low of -26.4, weaker than expectations of 2.2.\nNew York Fed President Williams said the US economy is in a very good place, and he doesn’t see the need to change the fed funds rate anytime soon.\nThe markets are discounting the chances at 11% for a -25 bp rate cut after the May 6-7 FOMC meeting, down from a 30% chance last week.\nEUR\/USD (^EURUSD) Thursday fell by -0.22%.  The euro retreated Thursday after the ECB cut interest rates by -25 bp and dropped the word “restrictive” to describe monetary policy.  Also, easing inflation pressure in the Eurozone is dovish for ECB policy after German March producer prices fell by the most in 5 months.  The euro added to its losses based on dovish comments from ECB President Lagarde, who said downside risks to economic growth have increased.    \nGerman Mar PPI fell -0.2% y\/y, weaker than expectations of +0.4% y\/y and the biggest decline in 5 months.\nAs expected, the ECB cut the deposit facility rate by -25 bp to 2.25% from 2.50%.  The post-meeting statement dropped the word “restrictive” to describe monetary policy and said, “The Eurozone economy has been building up some resilience against global shocks, but the outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions.”\nECB President Lagarde said downside risks to economic growth have increased, and most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 92% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the June 5 policy meeting.\nUSD\/JPY (^USDJPY) Thursday rose by +0.36%.  The yen on Thursday fell from a 6-3\/4 month high against the dollar and posted moderate losses on reduced safe-haven demand for the yen after President Trump said US negotiators made “big progress” with Japanese officials on a trade deal.  Weaker-than-expected Japanese trade news for March also weighed on the yen.  Losses in the yen accelerated after Japan’s chief trade negotiator said currencies weren’t discussed in US-Japan trade talks, allaying concerns the US would push for a stronger yen.\nThe yen also came under pressure Thursday on comments from BOJ Governor Ueda, who hinted that the BOJ would pause in considering interest rate hikes when he said, “We will assess the economy and inflation carefully for an appropriate policy decision by being duly mindful of rising uncertainties stemming from US tariff measures and other issues.”\nJune gold (GCM25) Thursday closed down -18.00 (-0.54%), and May silver (SIK25) closed down -0.510 (-1.55%).  Precious metals Thursday settled moderately lower.  June gold fell from a contract high Thursday, and nearest-futures (J25) gold dropped from a new record high of $3,345.0 an ounce on reduced safe-haven demand for precious metals in hopes trade agreements can be reached with US trading partners after President Trump said there was “big progress” in talks to strike a deal for Japan.  The dollar’s strength Thursday also weighed on metals prices.  In addition, hawkish comments Thursday from New York Fed President Williams undercut precious metals when he said he doesn’t see the need to change the fed funds rate anytime soon.\nLosses in precious metals were limited Thursday after the ECB cut interest rates by 25 bp today, and ECB President Lagarde said downside risks to economic growth have increased, which bolsters the outlook for additional ECB interest rate cuts.  The escalation of the US-China trade war also fuels safe-haven demand for precious metals.  Finally, geopolitical risks in the Middle East are boosting safe-haven demand for precious metals after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire broke down and as the US continues strikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebels.  Fund buying of gold supports prices after long gold positions in ETFs rose to a 1-1\/2 year high Wednesday. \nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

{"Date":"2025-04-20","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/crude-prices-finish-sharply-higher-us-trade-deal-hopes-and-iranian-oil-export-risks","Article":"May WTI crude oil (CLK25) Thursday closed up +2.21 (+3.54%), and May RBOB gasoline (RBK25) closed up +0.0554 (+2.71%).\nCrude oil and gasoline prices rallied sharply on Thursdays to 1-1\/2 week highs.  Optimism that the US will be able to make trade deals has reduced tariff concerns and boosted crude prices.  President Trump said that US negotiators made “big progress” with Japanese officials on a trade deal and expressed confidence that the US would reach a trade deal with the EU.  \nDon’t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart’s best-in-class commodity analysis.\n Also, doubts that the US will remove export restrictions on Iranian crude oil anytime soon are pushing oil prices higher, dousing some initial optimism earlier this week after US-Iranian officials met to discuss a new nuclear deal.  Crude rose Thursday because of concerns that nuclear talks between the US and Iran are not progressing, which reduces the potential of looser restrictions on Iranian crude.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said, “We are prepared to take all actions available to get Iran’s energy exports down to zero, where they belong.”\nStronger crude demand in China, the world’s largest crude importer, supports oil prices.  Reuters reported Monday that China Mar crude imports rose to 12.1 million bpd, the highest since August 2023.\nGoldman Sachs said Monday that global crude demand is being weighed down by the trade war and increased OPEC+ oil production, leading to “large surpluses” this year and next.  Goldman projects the global oil markets will be in a surplus of 800,000 bpd in 2025 and climb to a +1.4 million bpd surplus in 2026.\nCrude prices have been on the defensive over the past week and tumbled to a 4-year low last Wednesday.  Tariff turmoil is weighing energy prices on concerns about weaker global economic growth and energy demand even after President Trump paused his reciprocal tariffs last Wednesday.   Meanwhile, all the other previously announced Trump tariffs remain in place.\nCrude prices have a negative carryover from April 3, when OPEC+ said it would boost crude production in May by 411,000 bpd, much more than the +138,000 bpd of crude production it added this month.  OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production.  OPEC+ had previously planned to restore production between January and late 2025, but now that production cut won’t be fully restored until September 2026.  OPEC Mar crude production rose +80,000 bpd to a 13-month high of 27.43 million bpd.\nAn increase in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bearish for oil prices.  Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days rose by +0.4% w\/w to 65.72 million bbl in the week ended April 11.\nCrude oil found support when the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on March 20 sanctioned a China-based oil refinery and 19 entities and vessels tied to shipping Iranian crude oil.  The US is applying pressure to Iranian crude exports after President Trump recently sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei that said Iran has a two-month deadline to reach a new nuclear deal.  According to Rystad Energy A\/S, a maximum-pressure campaign could remove as much as 1.5 million bpd of Iranian crude exports from global markets, a bullish factor for crude.  \nCrude prices are being supported by tensions in the Middle East, which could lead to disruption of crude supplies from the region.  Israel continues to launch airstrikes across Gaza, ending a nearly two-month ceasefire with Hamas, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to act “with increasing military strength” to free hostages and disarm Hamas.  In addition, the US has launched strikes on Yemen’s Houthi rebels, and Defense Secretary Hegseth said strikes would be “unrelenting” until the group stops attacking vessels in the Red Sea.\nIn a supportive factor for crude oil prices, the US on January 10 imposed new sanctions on Russia’s oil industry that could curb global oil supplies.  The measures targeted Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftgas, which exported about 970,000 bpd of Russian crude in the first 10 months of 2024, accounting for about 30% of its tanker flow, according to Bloomberg data.  The US also targeted insurers and traders linked to hundreds of tanker cargoes.  Russian oil product exports in March rose to a 5-month high of 3.45 million bpd, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from analytics firm Vortexa.  Weekly vessel-tracking data from Bloomberg showed Russian crude exports fell by -40,000 bpd w\/w to 3.13 million bpd in the week to April 13.\nWednesday’s EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of April 11 were -5.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -10.2% below the 5-year seasonal average.  US crude oil production in the week ending April 11 was unchanged w\/w to 13.462 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd from the week of December 6.\nBaker Hughes reported Thursday that active US oil rigs in the week ending April 18 rose +1 to 481 rigs, moderately above the 3-year low of 472 rigs posted on January 24.  The number of US oil rigs has fallen over the past two years from the 4-1\/2 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022. \nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

{"Date":"2025-04-20","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/strength-global-demand-pushes-cocoa-prices-sharply-higher","Article":"May ICE NY cocoa (CCK25) Thursday closed up +269 (+3.32%), and May ICE London cocoa #7 (CAK25) closed up +241 (+4.13%).\nCocoa prices on Thursday posted sharp gains on signs of better-than-expected global cocoa demand.  Q1 European cocoa grindings fell -3.7% y\/y to 353,522 MT, a smaller decline than expectations for a -5% y\/y drop.  Also, Q1 Asian cocoa grinding fell -3.4% y\/y to 213,898 MT, a smaller decline than expectations for a fall of at least -5% y\/y.\nDon’t Miss a Day: From crude oil to coffee, sign up free for Barchart’s best-in-class commodity analysis.\n Last Wednesday, NY cocoa fell to a 1-month low, and London cocoa dropped to a 5-month low due to concern that consumer demand for cocoa and cocoa products will decline as the global trade war escalates and tariffs boost already-high cocoa prices.  Last Thursday, Barry Callebaut AG, one of the world's biggest chocolate makers, cut its annual sales guidance in the face of high cocoa prices and tariff uncertainty.  Meanwhile, Malaysia reported Monday a -15.3% y\/y decline in Q1 cocoa processing to 84.192 MT, and Brazil reported a -13% y\/y fall in Q1 cocoa bean grindings to 52.135 MT.  This Thursday, Asia, Europe, and North America will report their Q1 cocoa grinding figures.\nAn improving supply outlook has undercut cocoa prices.  On February 28, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024\/25, the first surplus in 4 years.  ICCO also projected that 2024\/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y\/y to 4.84 MMT.\nThe recovery in cocoa inventories is also bearish for prices.  Since falling to a 21-year low of 1,263,493 bags on January 24, ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have rebounded and climbed to a 5-3\/4 month high Thursday of 1,891,200 bags.  \nOn April 3, NY cocoa rose to a 1-3\/4 month high on signs of a weak mid-crop cocoa harvest in West Africa.  According to Rabobank, late-arriving rains in the region have limited crop growth, and recent cocoa farmer surveys from the Ivory Coast and Ghana have been disappointing.\nConcern about the Ivory Coast's upcoming mid-crop is supportive of cocoa prices.  The mid-crop is the smaller of two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts this month.  The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT.\nRecent Ivory Coast cocoa exports have slowed, supporting prices.  Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.45 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to April 13, up +10.7% from last year but down from the much larger 35% rise seen in December.\nDemand concerns are weighing on cocoa prices.  Executives from chocolate makers Hershey and Mondelez recently warned that high prices are hurting demand.  On February 4, Mondelez executives warned of a potential slowdown in chocolate demand when CFO Zarmella said, \"We are seeing signs, particularly in parts of the world like North America, where cocoa consumption is coming down.\"  Also, on February 18, the company warned that chocolate prices could rise as much as 50% due to the surge in cocoa prices, which would curb chocolate demand.  In addition, Hershey executives said on February 6 that high cocoa prices are forcing it to reformulate recipes by replacing cocoa with other ingredients.  \nAlso on the bearish side, Nigeria reported on February 27 that its Jan cocoa exports jumped +27% y\/y to 46,970 MT.  Nigeria is the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer.\nSmaller cocoa supplies from Ghana, the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, are supportive for prices after Cocobod, Ghana's cocoa regulator, cut its Ghana 2024\/25 cocoa harvest forecast in December for the second time this season to 617,500 MT, down -5% from an August estimate of 650,000 MT.  \nThe ICCO on February 28 said the 2023\/24 global cocoa deficit was -441,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years.  ICCO said 2023\/24 cocoa production fell -13.1% y\/y to 4.380 MMT.  ICCO said the 2023\/24 global cocoa stocks\/grindings ratio was 27.0%, a 46-year low. \nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Strength in crude oil benefits ethanol prices, which may prompt the world's sugar mills to divert more cane crushing to ethanol production rather than sugar, thus curbing sugar supplies.  \nSugar prices have been on the defensive this week, with NY sugar posting a 2-1\/2 year nearest-futures low Tuesday and London sugar posting a 2-3\/4 month low Wednesday.  The outlook for abundant rain in India that leads to a bumper sugar crop is undercutting sugar prices.  On Tuesday, India's Ministry of Earth Sciences projected an above-normal monsoon this year, with total rainfall forecast to be 105% of the long-term average.  India's monsoon season runs from June through September.  \nAlso, weighing on sugar prices is a concern that the global trade war will undercut world economic growth and that tariffs will raise sugar prices for consumers, curbing demand.\nAlso, on the negative side, consultant Datagro on March 12 projected that 2025\/26 Brazil Center-South sugar production would climb +6% y\/y to 42.4 MMT.  In addition, Green Pool Commodity Specialists on February 5 projected that the worldwide sugar market will shift to a surplus of +2.7 MMT in the 2025\/26 crop year from its estimate of a deficit of -3.7 MMT in 2024\/25.\nIn a bearish factor, the Indian government said on January 20 that it would allow its sugar mills to export 1 MMT of sugar this season, easing the restrictions placed on sugar exports in 2023.  India has restricted sugar exports since October 2023 to maintain adequate domestic supplies.  India allowed mills to export only 6.1 MMT of sugar during the 2022\/23 season to September 30 after allowing exports of a record 11.1 MMT in the previous season.  However, the ISMA projects that India's 2024\/25 sugar production will fall -17.5% y\/y to a 5-year low of 26.4 MMT.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices.  On October 29, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board projected that Thailand's 2024\/25 sugar production would jump by +18% y\/y to 10.35 MMT.  Thailand produced 8.77 MMT of sugar in the 2023\/24 season that ended in April.  Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest sugar exporter.\nSigns of lower global sugar production are supportive of prices.  Unica reported Monday that the cumulative 2024\/25 Brazil Center-South sugar output through March fell by 5.3% y\/y to 40.169 MMT.  On March 12,  the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association cut its 2024\/25 India sugar production forecast to 26.4 MMT from a January forecast of 27.27 MMT, citing lower cane yields.  \nMeanwhile, the International Sugar Organization (ISO) on March 6 raised its 2024\/25 global sugar deficit forecast to -4.88 MMT from a November forecast of -2.51 MMT, showing a tightening market from the 2023\/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT.  The ISO also cut its 2024\/25 global sugar production forecast to 175.5 MMT from a November forecast of 179.1 MMT.  \nDrought and excessive heat last year caused fires in Brazil that damaged sugar crops in Brazil's top sugar-producing state of Sao Paulo.  Green Pool Commodity Specialists noted that as much as 5 MMT of sugar cane may have been lost due to the fires.  On Thursday, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, projected 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production to fall -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.  \nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released November 21, projected that global 2024\/25 sugar production would climb +1.5% y\/y to a record 186.619 MMT and that global 2024\/25 human sugar consumption would increase +1.2% y\/y to a record 179.63 MMT.  The USDA also forecasted that 2024\/25 global sugar ending stocks would decline -6.1% y\/y to 45.427 MMT. \nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/urban-edge-properties-ue-could-be-great-choice","Article":"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\nUrban Edge Properties in Focus\nHeadquartered in New York, Urban Edge Properties (UE) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -14.98% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.19 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 4.16%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield is 4.64%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.69%.\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $0.76 is up 11.8% from last year. Urban Edge Properties has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11.83%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Urban Edge Properties's current payout ratio is 51%. This means it paid out 51% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nEarnings growth looks solid for UE for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $1.40 per share, with earnings expected to increase 3.70% from the year ago period.\nBottom Line\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, UE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this meat producer have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Food - Meat Products industry, which Tyson falls in, has gained 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Tyson is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share, indicating a change of +37.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.82 points to a change of +23.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.10 indicates a change of +7.3% from what Tyson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Tyson.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Tyson, the consensus sales estimate of $13.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.2%. The $53.76 billion and $54.38 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.9% and +1.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nTyson reported revenues of $13.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $0.69 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.09%. The EPS surprise was +44.3%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nTyson is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tyson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has gained 2.6% over this period.

It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate of $17.76 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.7%. The $91.66 billion and $94.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.2% and +3.5%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nPepsiCo reported revenues of $27.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.2%. EPS of $1.96 for the same period compares with $1.78 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.9 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.4%.

Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nPepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

But have they been good investments? And if so, which one has performed better?\nFind Out: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell\nRead Next: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nHere’s how each company’s stock has performed from 2015 to 2025, the factors that fueled their results and which may be a stronger pick for investors in 2025.\n10-Year Snapshot: Toyota and Ford Prices From 2015 to 2025\nToyota’s stock 2015-2025 :\n2015: Toyota ended the year near $93.98 and averaged about $97.93, marking a slight 0.89% annual gain.\n2020: The closing price reached about $138.88, showing an annual rise of 13.62%. Even in a difficult year across the globe, Toyota’s consistent production and diverse product lines helped.\n2025: Toyota’s closing price (as of April 15, 2025) is $174.24. Over the 10-year span, the stock is significantly higher than in 2015.\nFord’s stock 2015-2025:\n2015: Ford ended at roughly $8.47, down 5.40% from 2014. \n2020: By year-end, Ford hovered around $6.94, a decline of about 3.88% for 2020. The onset of the pandemic disrupted sales and production, though Ford started unveiling new electric plans.\n2025: The price sits near $9.45 as of April 15. While that’s above where it stood in late 2015, it’s not by much compared to Toyota’s stock price jump.\nLearn More: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Bought Over $73 Million in Shares of This Tech Company — Here’s Why\nWhy Toyota’s Stock Rose More Sharply Than Ford’s\nHere’s a look at why Toyota stock has had the edge.\nToyota’s Hybrid Reputation and Investor Confidence\nToyota became synonymous with hybrids like the Prius. That reputation built investor trust, showing that Toyota could handle shifts toward cleaner vehicles without heavy volatility. The automaker’s success with mild hybrids, which do not plug in, boosted sales in many regions eager to cut emissions.\nToyota Avoided the Peak Hype Cycle\nWhile many competitors made bold announcements about going all electric, Toyota kept a slower, more methodical approach. Analysts point out that Toyota didn’t talk up electric vehicles to the same extent as Ford or General Motors. That meant Toyota avoided the “peak hype” moment in late 2021 when auto stocks soared on big EV targets. It also avoided the subsequent letdown many faced when EV rollouts fell behind schedule. \n\nIn contrast, in 2021 and 2022, Ford made sweeping claims about ramping up electric-vehicle development. It announced major investments — $50 billion by 2026 — to stake a leadership role in battery-electric models. Yet production delays and supply-chain problems affected the Mach-E and the electric F-150. Investors grew wary when it became clear these ambitious targets might be harder to meet in the near term.\nToyota’s Large Global Footprint and Cost Discipline\nToyota’s large reach across Asia, Europe and North America buffered it against dips in any single market. It also maintained cost discipline, often ending years with high levels of cash on hand. Such prudence, along with a reliable dividend history, tends to attract buy-and-hold investors seeking a stable carmaker.\nOutlook for 2025\nBoth companies have big decisions to make. Toyota plans to expand battery-electric models in the coming years but also invests in fuel-cell and hybrid systems. Ford is rolling out electric crossovers and trucks and is aiming to scale production, though the path to profitability remains uncertain.\nToyota’s record points to incremental gains over hype-driven swings. The company may never see Tesla-like valuations, but it has rewarded loyal shareholders with fewer surprises. However, if you believe Ford’s EV pivot will succeed and that truck and SUV sales will keep profits solid, you might see upside there as well. Just remember, Ford’s shares have faced heavy volatility and sometimes follow big expansions with big pullbacks.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Used Luxury SUVs That Are a Good Investment for Retirees\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n7 Overpriced Grocery Items Frugal People Should Quit Buying in 2025\n4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Toyota vs. Ford: Which Stock Has Seen Better Returns Over the Last 10 Years? \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index is down 10% year to date on April 17. Realty Income gained 7.2%. If you reinvested the company's monthly dividend payouts over this period, you'd have a 9.3% gain instead. The broader market's dividends barely made a difference over the same period, lifting the S&P 500's returns to 10.3%.\nA lot of people invest in this real estate investment trust (REIT) to take advantage of that incredible dividend. There's nothing wrong with that approach, and you can lock in some of its highest yields in history by picking up a few shares right now.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\nAfter all, the recent price gain is actually a rebound from a long period of underperformance. Realty Income took a hard hit in the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the stock fell far behind the broader market over the last five years:\nO Total Return Level data by YCharts\nBut I'm not here to remind you of this unique Dividend King's 658 uninterrupted dividend payouts or its unusually inviting 5.5% yield. I just want to remind you that Realty Income's business is based on one of the most reliable wealth-creation tools in human history: high-quality real estate.\nReal estate investing for the win\nYou know the old saw about McDonald's actually being a real estate business that also happens to sell some burgers. Have you seen the award-winning movie Crazy Rich Asians? The entire premise of that film is that long-term ownership of land creates incredible wealth, especially in important economic hot spots like Singapore.\nRealty Income doesn't own central Singapore, but it holds 339 million square feet of real estate, mostly prime retail space, in eight countries. The addressable market is worth $5.4 trillion in America and another $8.5 trillion in Europe, where Realty Income has started to expand.\nIf cash is king, real estate is the emperor. It's really difficult to be \"too late\" to take advantage of an everlasting business opportunity.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $524,747!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $622,041!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 792% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 153% for the S&P 500.

He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.\nAdditional Research Links\nTop Financial Stocks\nDividend Aristocrats 2025\nWide Moat Stocks\nRecession Proof Stocks\nCheapest Value Stocks\nFactor-Based Stock Portfolios\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/these-2-oils-and-energy-stocks-could-beat-earnings-why-they-should-be-your-radar-21","Article":"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\nThe ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.\nThe core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction. The Zacks Rank is also factored into the ESP metric to better help find companies that appear poised to top their next bottom-line consensus estimate, which will hopefully help lift the stock price.\nWhen we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\nStocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.\nShould You Consider EOG Resources?\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to quickly look at a qualifying stock. EOG Resources (EOG) holds a #3 (Hold) at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.75 a share 13 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 1, 2025.\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $2.75 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.74 Zacks Consensus Estimate, EOG Resources has an Earnings ESP of +0.14%. Investors should also know that EOG is one of a large group of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nEOG is one of just a large database of Oils and Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Weatherford (WFRD).\nSlated to report earnings on April 22, 2025, Weatherford holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.90 a share four days from its next quarterly update.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Weatherford is $0.89, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +1.5%.\nEOG and WFRD's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Mohanram turned that research on its head by developing a growth model that produced significant market outperformance. His research paper \"Separating Winners from Losers among Low Book-to-Market Stocks using Financial Statement Analysis\" looked at the criteria that can be used to separate growth stocks that continue their upward trajectory from those that don't. Mohanram is currently the John H. Watson Chair in Value Investing at the University of Toronto and was previously an Associate Professor at the Columbia Business School.\nAdditional Research Links\nTop S&P 500 Stocks\nTop Russell 2000 Stocks\nDividend Growth Stocks\nHigh Free Cash Flow Yield Stocks\nSmall-Cap Value Stocks\nLow Volatility Stocks\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/these-2-oils-and-energy-stocks-could-beat-earnings-why-they-should-be-your-radar-22","Article":"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\nThe earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.\nHunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information.\nNow that we understand the basic idea, let's look at how the Expected Surprise Prediction works. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.\nWhen we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\nStocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.\nShould You Consider Coterra Energy?\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Coterra Energy (CTRA) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.84 a share, just 17 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 5, 2025.\nCTRA has an Earnings ESP figure of +12.3%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.84 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.75. Coterra Energy is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nCTRA is one of just a large database of Oils and Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Clearway Energy (CWEN).\nClearway Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 30, 2025. CWEN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.03 a share 12 days from its next earnings release.\nFor Clearway Energy, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.30 is +108.5%.\nCTRA and CWEN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here >>\nShould You Invest in Coterra Energy Inc. (CTRA)?\nBefore you invest in Coterra Energy Inc. (CTRA), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/singapore-cuts-growth-expectations-amidst-tariffs","Article":"Singapore has been a strong economy for the past few decades, surviving storms like COVID quite well. This is due to their strong investment in finance and technology companies, helping the countries GDP. However, amidst strong historical economic performance, Singapore has cut growth expectations due to US tariffs.\nSingapore Cuts Growth Expectations Amidst Tariffs\nLeaders of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) predict their local economy could have zero growth in 2025. This is a downgrade from previous GDP growth to 0% from 3% initially. The Ministry of Trade and Industry said “sweeping tariffs introduced by the U.S., and the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, are expected to weigh significantly on global trade and global economic growth.” MAS agrees with the Ministry of Trade and Industry because key trade partners of Singapore are expecting lower business and economic confidence. However, other economists are a bit more optimistic. Capital Economics markets economist Shivaan Tandon believes that Singapore’s economy will improve by 2% during the year, which is down from their previous estimate of 3%\nAsia as a whole is heavily reliant upon trade, so these tariffs certainly won’t help Asian countries economically. India, New Zealand, and the Philippines have all relaxed economic policies due to Trump’s tariffs. Experts saw the financial sector in Southeast Asia slowed in the first quarter of 2025. In fact, Singapore’s economy decreased 0.8% from Q4 to Q1. This is due to a decrease in the financial sector but also a slowing of the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing is a large contributor to Singapore’s GDP, but growth slowed from 7.4% to 5%, quarter over quarter. However, MAS believes that inflation may slow in the process. MAS forecasts inflation to be anywhere between 0.5% and 1.5%, down from the initial estimate of 1.5% and 2.5%.Experts in the Asian economic area also expect more and more easing of economic policies to adjust for the uncertainty. Central banks likely will only continue to ease policies if they believe those are necessary.\nFeatured Image Credit: Kin Pastor; Pexels: Thank You!\nThe post Singapore Cuts Growth Expectations Amidst Tariffs appeared first on Due.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\nHunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.\nWith this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.\nWhen we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\nStocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.\nShould You Consider Eaton?\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Eaton (ETN) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.74 a share, just 11 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 29, 2025.\nETN has an Earnings ESP figure of +1.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.74 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.70. Eaton is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nETN is just one of a large group of Industrial Products stocks with a positive ESP figure. Parker-Hannifin (PH) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\nSlated to report earnings on May 1, 2025, Parker-Hannifin holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $6.80 a share 13 days from its next quarterly update.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Parker-Hannifin is $6.73, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +1.01%.\nETN and PH's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\nLife and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.\nNow that we know how important earnings and earnings surprises are, it's time to show investors how to take advantage of these events to boost their returns by utilizing the Zacks Earnings ESP filter.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.\nThe core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction. The Zacks Rank is also factored into the ESP metric to better help find companies that appear poised to top their next bottom-line consensus estimate, which will hopefully help lift the stock price.\nWhen we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time.

Annaly Capital Management (NLY) holds a #2 (Buy) at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.73 a share 12 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 30, 2025.\nAnnaly Capital Management's Earnings ESP sits at +3.55%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.73 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.71.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/rachel-cruze-why-you-should-actually-pay-your-house-early","Article":"When we hear money experts talking about how the accumulation of debt seriously hinders our ability to build wealth or comfortably retire, they’re usually talking about high-interest debt, like that associated with credit cards. Usually, they’re not talking about mortgage debt, which many money experts go so far as to call “good debt.” Why? \nFind Out: I’m a Financial Advisor: My Wealthiest Clients All Do These 3 Things\nRead Next: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nMortgage debt is sometimes called good debt because it’s associated with an investment that is expected to appreciate in value over time. Additionally, the vast majority of mortgages in the U.S. (92%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis) are fixed-rate, meaning the interest rate remains the same over the life of the loan and don’t, for example, change when inflation goes up. \nBoth Cruze and Dave Ramsey Are Pro Paying Your Mortgage Down ASAP\nThe general consensus may be to not be in a hurry to pay off your mortgage — unless, of course, you have a ton of excess cash and are already well ahead of your retirement savings goals. Rachel Cruze is one of the few famous financial experts who doesn’t agree with this thinking. And actually, her father, fellow financial expert Dave Ramsey, doesn’t either. They both passionately argue the importance of paying off your mortgage ASAP. Why does Cruze, in particular, believe you should pay off your house early?  \nLearn More: Suze Orman’s Top Tip for Building Wealth Is a ‘Very Easy One’\nA Mortgage May Not Be ‘Bad’ Debt, but It’s Still Debt \nIn a recent video posted to her social media channels, Cruze shot down the common retort she hears when advising people to pay off their mortgage early. They say something along the lines of, “But why not invest that cash in the market and make 10, 11% returns on it?”\nThis argument seems to make sense if you locked in a low-rate mortgage for, say 2% or 3%. But there’s a flaw in it that Cruze sums up perfectly in her reply. \n“My question back always is, ‘If your house was paid off, would you borrow on your house to go invest in the market?’ The answer is usually no.” \nHaving No Mortgage Will Give You Peace of Mind \nMortgage debt may not be destructive the way credit card debt is, but it’s still a liability. It doesn’t feel good to carry it around or to be held responsible for it. We may fantasize about the day we’ve paid off our mortgage. How liberating will it be to finally not have to pay for shelter? To just have it all taken care of and behind you? It would be a real kind of freedom.  \nCruze gets that. And that’s why she wants to see us all tackle our mortgages and make them disappear earlier than we have to by law. \n“There is something about peace of mind,” Cruze said. “When you don’t owe anyone anything.”  \nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Types of Vehicles Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Rachel Cruze: Why You Should Actually Pay Your House Off Early\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/procter-gamble-company-pg-trending-stock-facts-know-betting-it-6","Article":"Procter & Gamble (PG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry, to which P&G belongs, has gained 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share, indicating a change of +1.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.87 points to a change of +4.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.8%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.27 indicates a change of +5.8% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for P&G.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor P&G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.34 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $84.94 billion and $87.53 billion estimates indicate +1.1% and +3.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nP&G reported revenues of $21.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $1.88 for the same period compares with $1.84 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.33%. The EPS surprise was +1.08%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nP&G is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren’t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/president-trumps-145-china-tariffs-will-hurt-amazon-heres-why-im-still-buying-stock","Article":"Few companies are as harmed by the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Its massive e-commerce platform sources many goods from China, which will see a dramatic price increase as the U.S. tariff rate on goods from there now sits at 145% -- at least, for the moment. However, that rate could easily change, as the two sides have not yet backed down.\nWhile some may think that Amazon will be a casualty in this trade war, other facts dispute this claim. As a result, I think using the weakness on the tariff fears to buy Amazon stock is the smart move, as there are far more factors to Amazon than just its e-commerce business.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\nAmazon's e-commerce platform isn't the primary reason to invest in the stock\nLet's address the elephant in the room: Of more than 1,000 third-party sellers surveyed by ECDB, 71% said that they sourced at least one product from China. This means that there are a ton of goods on Amazon's e-commerce platform that come from China, which could see a huge price hike shortly. In return, higher prices could cause consumers to spend less, hurting Amazon's total e-commerce sales.\nWhile this is less than ideal, it's still not as big of a deal as some investors make it out to be. The reason? Most of Amazon's profits don't come from its e-commerce store. While a large chunk of revenue comes from Amazon's online store and third-party seller services, there isn't much profit from these areas.\nSubscription and ad services are a key part of Amazon's commerce division, and they raise its overall profit margins, making it hard to pinpoint exactly what Amazon's commerce profit margins are. However, if you look at a retailer like Walmart (NYSE: WMT), its profit margins are consistently below 3%. In contrast, subscription services are likely a very high-margin business, as is advertising.\nMeanwhile, advertising-centric companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are delivering profit margins of nearly 40%, which means ad revenue produces far more profit than commerce revenue.\nIn Q4, Amazon's online stores and third-party seller services totaled $123.1 billion in revenue, while ad and subscription services totaled $28.8 billion. If the commerce subsection posted a 3% profit margin and the ad and subscription services posted a 35% margin, the commerce subsection would have produced $3.7 billion in profits while the ad and subscription service produced $10 billion.\nWhile these are estimated figures, they give investors a good idea of how unaffected Amazon's business will be overall if its commerce revenue struggles to grow. This is a key fact, as Amazon may see its overall revenue struggle to grow, but profits will likely continue growing. Additionally, Amazon's most important segment is relatively unharmed by tariffs.\nAWS is a critical part of Amazon's profit picture\nAnother important part of Amazon’s business is its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services; the company specifically breaks out the figures for that division, so we know the margins. AWS is a huge component of Amazon and displays an even larger profit share compared to the revenue it brings in. In 2024, AWS accounted for 58% of Amazon's operating profit margin despite accounting for 17% of sales.\nCloud computing's tailwinds aren't going away as they benefit from two trends. The first is the general movement from workloads on local servers to those on the cloud. Many companies are finding this is a far more efficient way to run workstations, as they don't have to worry about maintaining the servers once they buy them. Additionally, it's easy to scale usage up or down, which allows them to be more flexible, where that ability is lost if you purchase your own server.\nAnother tailwind to cloud computing is artificial intelligence (AI). Most companies don't have the computing power necessary to run AI workloads and can't justify spending millions of dollars on a supercomputer to develop their own models. Instead, training them on Amazon's cutting-edge servers is more cost-effective.\nThis is a long-term growth trend for Amazon, and there isn't a ton that tariffs can do to disrupt this movement. Growth from AWS may or may not cancel out any revenue difficulties Amazon experiences on its commerce side, but with Amazon's growing ad business and cloud computing offering, Amazon's profits will likely continue growing at a rapid pace.\nAs a result, I think Amazon stock is an excellent buy here, as most of the market is focusing on the wrong metric.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Potlatch (PCH) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole?

The Construction group currently sits at #15 within the Zacks Sector Rank.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/portland-general-electric-por-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy","Article":"The market expects Portland General Electric (POR) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.4%.\nRevenues are expected to be $947.86 million, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Portland General Electric?\nFor Portland General Electric, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.19%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Portland General Electric will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Portland General Electric would post earnings of $0.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.34, delivering a surprise of +6.25%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nPortland General Electric appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, CenterPoint Energy (CNP) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.55 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.66 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for CenterPoint has been revised 4.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.82%.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CenterPoint will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/philip-morris-pm-217-one-week-what-you-should-know","Article":"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Philip Morris (PM), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Philip Morris currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PM that show why this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\nFor PM, shares are up 2.17% over the past week while the Zacks Tobacco industry is up 2.48% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.04% compares favorably with the industry's 3.17% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Philip Morris have increased 30.12% over the past quarter, and have gained 78.96% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -11.63% and 6.63%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of PM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PM is averaging 7,233,862 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PM.\nOver the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PM's consensus estimate, increasing from $7.13 to $7.23 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PM is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Philip Morris on your short list.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/philip-morris-international-inc-pm-hits-fresh-high-there-still-room-run","Article":"Shares of Philip Morris (PM) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $165 in the previous session. Philip Morris has gained 35.6% since the start of the year compared to the 6.6% move for the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the 26.7% return for the Zacks Tobacco industry.\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 6, 2025, Philip Morris reported EPS of $1.55 versus consensus estimate of $1.51.\nFor the current fiscal year, Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $7.23 per share on $40.6 billion in revenues. This represents a 10.05% change in EPS on a 7.18% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.03 per share on $43.95 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.03% and 8.26%, respectively.\nValuation Metrics\nPhilip Morris may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nPhilip Morris has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 22.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 11X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 21X versus its peer group's average of 10.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.77. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Philip Morris currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Philip Morris fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Philip Morris shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

Revenues are forecasted to be $20.34 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 0.7%.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific P&G metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net sales- Beauty' will likely reach $3.52 billion.

The estimate suggests a change of +1.4% year over year.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net sales- Health Care' should arrive at $2.92 billion. The estimate points to a change of +1.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Earnings before income taxes- Beauty' will reach $781.26 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $753 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Earnings before income taxes- Grooming' at $401.57 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $379 million.\nAnalysts expect 'Earnings before income taxes- Health Care' to come in at $721.75 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $687 million.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Earnings before income taxes- Fabric & Home Care' of $1.78 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $1.69 billion in the same quarter last year.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Earnings before income taxes- Baby, Feminine & Family Care' will reach $1.35 billion. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $1.30 billion.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for P&G here>>>\n\nOver the past month, shares of P&G have returned +1.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/schlumberger-slb-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-can-stock-move-higher","Article":"The market expects Schlumberger (SLB) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.3%.\nRevenues are expected to be $8.6 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.86% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger?\nFor Schlumberger, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.20%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Schlumberger will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +2.22%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nSchlumberger appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, Core Laboratories (CLB) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.15 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -21.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $124.06 million, down 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Core Laboratories has been revised 18.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.27%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Core Laboratories will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in Schlumberger Limited (SLB)?\nBefore you invest in Schlumberger Limited (SLB), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -6.94% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nCurrently, Signet has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision indicates a downward shift.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\nThe earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.\nThe ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.\nWith this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.\nIn fact, when we combined a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Perhaps most importantly, using these parameters has helped produce 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\nStocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.\nShould You Consider Allstate?\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Allstate (ALL) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.79 a share, just 12 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 30, 2025.\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $3.79 Most Accurate Estimate and the $3.78 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Allstate has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%.

In a recent letter, Tejon emphasized that Bulldog's attempt to gain control would jeopardize decades of shareholder investment and undermine the value of the Company’s long-term development and land entitlement efforts, especially in California's challenging regulatory environment.

(NYSE:TRC), (“Tejon” or the “Company”), a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company, today mailed a letter to shareholders in connection with its upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) to be held on May 13, 2025.\n\n\nTejon Ranch urges shareholders to vote\n\n“FOR”\n\nthe Company’s director nominees only, which are located on the Company’s\n\nWHITE\n\nproxy card, and withhold votes from Bulldog Investors' nominees. The full text of the letter follows:\n\n\nDear Fellow Tejon Ranch Shareholders,\n\n\nWe are reaching out to you directly because your vote on the Company’s\n\nWHITE\n\nproxy card\n\nONLY\n\n\n“FOR”\n\nTejon’s 10 director nominees is critical to preserving\n\nthe value of your investment\n\n.\n\n\nBy voting, you have the power to protect your investment from Bulldog Investors’ (“Bulldog”) short-sighted, self-serving and last second campaign. Despite attempting to take control of nearly 30% of the Tejon Board of Directors (\"Board\"), Bulldog has presented shareholders with nothing but questions.\n\nEven more concerning, Bulldog appears to have no plan beyond choking off investment to Tejon’s highly valuable residential development projects\n\n– putting at risk years of entitlement and execution progress by the Company on behalf of our shareholders.\n\n\nBulldog's failure to articulate a value creation plan demonstrates a lack of the planning, analysis and thoughtfulness that is required to successfully oversee the execution of California real estate development, including the interconnected operations of Tejon.\n\n\n\n\nBulldog's nominees have no meaningful experience in real estate, land development, or California-specific regulation, which are disciplines essential to governing a company like Tejon. Bulldog’s nominees also lack understanding of the Company’s many separate business assets, unlike the Company’s recommended Board nominees. Phillip Goldstein and Andrew Dakos have built their careers in closed-end funds, not at operating companies or land-based businesses. Their track record, even in that narrow field, is mediocre, with the funds they oversee regularly trading at discounts to net asset value\n\n1\n\n. Mr. Goldstein himself has publicly admitted that Bulldog's involvement at Emergent Capital was a failure.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nBulldog’s third nominee, Aaron Morris, is closely tied to Bulldog. He has repeatedly acted as Bulldog’s litigation counsel and appears to have been nominated primarily to serve Bulldog’s interests, not the interests of all shareholders,\n\n3\n\non which the Company-recommended nominees are focused.\n\n\n\n\nElecting the Bulldog nominees would hand over strategic oversight of your Company, which is located in the most complex business climate in the U.S., to individuals with a history of poor shareholder outcomes. That’s a risk Tejon’s shareholders should not accept.\n\n\n\nTejon’s Proven History of Success in Development and\n\n\n\n\nObtaining Key Land Use Entitlements Creates Long-Term Value\n\n\n\nIn stark contrast, our shareholders made their investments in Tejon because the Company is executing\n\nthe right, long-term strategy to maximize the value of the unique asset that is the Ranch\n\n. One of our differentiating core competencies is our impressive track record of securing and defending land use approvals and then executing development, especially in California's challenging regulatory environment. The Company’s recommended nominees understand that the barriers of entry into California real estate are only becoming more pronounced and, as a result, the Company’s achievements to date are extremely valuable for Tejon’s shareholders going forward. Bulldog’s nominees appear to disregard this basic California principle.\n\n\nFor real estate assets like Tejon, the value differential between raw land and fully entitled commercial, industrial and residential land is immense. Tejon has been deliberately investing the time, effort and resources to entitle Tejon’s land holdings into valuable master planned communities (“MPCs”) over many years. This includes, after proceeding through the difficult and unique California entitlement process, successfully executing construction, sales, leasing and developing cash generating assets for our shareholders. In other words, Tejon’s Board and executive team have been taking the right steps to realize that immense value differential for our shareholders.\n\nWhat Tejon’s investors understand – and Bulldog seems to not understand – is that in real estate, a finite short-term focus can destroy compounding long-term value.\n\n\n\nTejon has a decades-long track record of creating value by entitling MPCs and successfully defending them against litigation in an extremely challenging California regulatory environment. Furthermore, our success in progressing our MPCs – including the highly successful\n\nTejon Ranch Commerce Center\n\n(“TRCC”) – has been due in large part to our strong working relationships with local, state and federal decision makers. Investors know that “all real estate is local,” and Bulldog’s proposal to cease investment in the MPCs not only jeopardizes future value creation — it risks undermining the trust, goodwill and brand equity we’ve built with the very stakeholders who have supported our projects and risked their reputations on obtaining approvals for Tejon Ranch master plans and projects. The Board strongly believes that introducing Bulldog’s nominees and their lack of the necessary qualifications, relationships or real estate experience would put our Company at risk.\n\n\n\nLong-Term, Strategic Approach to Development Drives Virtuous Value Cycle\n\n\n\nTejon shareholders are already benefiting from our focused efforts. Our proven value creation strategy is generating recurring revenues and cash flows from our successful TRCC MPC. TRCC was created using the same land use entitlement process as our other MPCs –\n\nMountain Village\n\n,\n\nGrapevine\n\nand\n\nCentennial\n\n. Now Bulldog wants Tejon to cease our investments in the very assets that are the building blocks of our strategic plan for future shareholder value creation and cash flow generation. The 10 years of securing approvals at TRCC have produced more than $110 million of cumulative cash flow from commercial and industrial development.\n\n\nMPC development requires long-term, strategic planning to optimize the value and interconnectivity of all assets. Tejon takes a measured and purposeful approach to strategic reinvestment in our landholdings as we advance our projects. To this end, Tejon has reduced discretionary land use entitlement spending for its MPCs by 38% over the past five years as our MPCs have secured entitlements and we have successfully defended them against litigation which our shareholders understand is capital intensive. We have been successful in spreading our risks across different investments and by utilizing partnerships. Moreover, we were 2½ times oversubscribed in a 2017 rights offering and have continued to advance our approval efforts without requiring additional shareholder equity due to our prudent capital allocation. Additionally, Company headcount has decreased by nearly half over the past ten years as Tejon has outsourced portions of its business, while still building internal execution knowledge and becoming more efficient. All of this is being accomplished by maintaining very low debt on our balance sheet.\n\n\n\nTejon’s Board is Best Positioned to Continue our Value Creation Strategy\n\n\n\nTejon’s directors are best equipped to oversee our unique and complex business strategy, and the very difficult land use entitlement process required to derive value from it. Our directors bring skills and expertise that are crucial to our business, particularly as it relates to California’s commercial and residential real estate industry.\n\nTheir leadership, knowledge and commitment are exactly what Tejon needs to thrive\n\ngoing forward into a great execution and development phase of our business.\n\n\n\n\nIf Bulldog succeeds in its misguided campaign, the long-term value of Tejon will be significantly compromised.\n\n\nBulldog has only recently accumulated shares in Tejon, with the aim of making a quick return. We believe Bulldog’s short-term focus would erase decades of hard work, shareholder investment and value over the long-term and delay shareholder returns.\n\n\n\nSince Bulldog can cumulate votes at the shareholder meeting, it has an outsized influence compared to its position in Tejon.\n\nWe urge you to vote\n\nONLY\n\nin favor of Tejon’s\n\n10\n\nnominees on the Company’s\n\nWHITE\n\nproxy card and\n\nwithhold all votes from Bulldog’s nominees\n\n. Your support is essential to preserving Tejon’s ability to drive long-term value for shareholders and create a real path forward for real returns back to shareholders upon the future implementation of all our MPC's.\n\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nThe Tejon Ranch Co. Board of Directors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT, NO MATTER HOW MANY SHARES YOU OWN.\n\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY VOTE BY THE INTERNET OR MAIL BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE\n\nWHITE\n\nPROXY CARD.\n\nWE URGE YOU TO VOTE TODAY!\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or require any assistance with voting your shares, please contact:\n\n\n\n\nD.F.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\nBoth Southwest Gas and Atmos Energy have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nSWX currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 19.66, while ATO has a forward P\/E of 21.92. We also note that SWX has a PEG ratio of 2.07. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ATO currently has a PEG ratio of 3.05.\nAnother notable valuation metric for SWX is its P\/B ratio of 1.43. Investors use the P\/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ATO has a P\/B of 1.92.\nBased on these metrics and many more, SWX holds a Value grade of B, while ATO has a Value grade of D.\nBoth SWX and ATO are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that SWX is the superior value option right now.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

The implementation uses the Lightning Network through DFX Swiss’s OpenCryptoPay solution, enabling instant transactions at the point of sale.\nThe store’s location in Zug, often called “Crypto Valley,” reflects Switzerland’s embrace of technology. The country has emerged as a global leader in bitcoin adoption, with cities like Zug and Lugano spearheading initiatives to integrate bitcoin into everyday transactions.\nLugano, in particular, has made headlines with its “Plan ₿” initiative, which aims to make bitcoin a de facto legal tender in the city. The plan, supported by Mayor Michele Foletti, has already enabled bitcoin payments for taxes, public services, and at hundreds of local merchants. The city has also partnered with Tether to establish a technology education centre and startup fund.\n“This SPAR location is among the first supermarkets in Switzerland where you can pay directly at the checkout using Bitcoin via LNURL,” DFX Swiss announced. The implementation could pave the way for expansion across SPAR’s network of over 13,900 stores in 48 countries, which serves approximately 14.7 million customers daily.\nBitcoin Association Switzerland director Rahim Taghizadegan demonstrated the system’s simplicity: “Just scan a static QR code, send sats, immediate and easy registration by the cashier.” This user-friendly approach aligns with Switzerland’s vision of making bitcoin transactions accessible to everyday consumers.\nThe country’s bitcoin-friendly stance has attracted numerous bitcoin and crypto n companies and initiatives. Beyond Zug and Lugano, cities across Switzerland are exploring similar programs, supported by a robust banking sector that increasingly embracing bitcoin.\nSPAR’s initiative builds on this foundation, joining other Swiss retailers and businesses in accepting bitcoin payments. The move could influence adoption across the retail sector, particularly given Switzerland’s role as a model for bitcoin integration in traditional finance and commerce.\nThis post Spar Supermarket in Switzerland Starts Accepting Bitcoin first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Vivek Sen Bitcoin.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nRight now, Smiths Group PLC is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while AppLovin has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that SMGZY has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nSMGZY currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 15.84, while APP has a forward P\/E of 35.65. We also note that SMGZY has a PEG ratio of 1.39. This metric is used similarly to the famous P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. APP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.78.\nAnother notable valuation metric for SMGZY is its P\/B ratio of 2.93. The P\/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, APP has a P\/B of 74.33.\nBased on these metrics and many more, SMGZY holds a Value grade of B, while APP has a Value grade of F.\nSMGZY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that SMGZY is likely the superior value option right now.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

With over 1.2 billion mobile phone users and the second-largest internet user base globally, India is now a important test-bed for emerging technologies such as AI, 5G, and cloud computing.\n\n\nGovernment initiatives like ‘Digital India’ and ‘Startup India’ have further accelerated tech innovation, with India now home to over 100 unicorns. For global enterprises, the convergence of policy support, digital infrastructure, and deep talent positions India as a growth opportunity that is both immediate and immense.”\n\n\n\nMr. M P Vijay Kumar, ED & Group CFO, said,\n\n“We remain committed to cost efficiency and fiscal discipline, aligning our financial strategies with long-term value creation across all our businesses.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.\nOn top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the \"Value\" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and \"A\" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.\nWynn Resorts (WYNN) is a stock many investors are watching right now. WYNN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P\/E ratio of 13.94. This compares to its industry's average Forward P\/E of 26.80. Over the last 12 months, WYNN's Forward P\/E has been as high as 20.46 and as low as 12.57, with a median of 16.54.\nValue investors also frequently use the P\/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. WYNN has a P\/S ratio of 1.11. This compares to its industry's average P\/S of 1.15.\nThese are only a few of the key metrics included in Wynn Resorts's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, WYNN looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\nOne stock to keep an eye on is Smart Sand (SND). SND is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P\/E ratio of 10.47 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P\/E of 10.98. Over the past year, SND's Forward P\/E has been as high as 41.69 and as low as -5,657.50, with a median of 13.37.\nValue investors also frequently use the P\/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. SND has a P\/S ratio of 0.28. This compares to its industry's average P\/S of 0.63.\nFinally, we should also recognize that SND has a P\/CF ratio of 2.38. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. SND's P\/CF compares to its industry's average P\/CF of 5.91. Within the past 12 months, SND's P\/CF has been as high as 4.32 and as low as 2.04, with a median of 2.69.\nThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Smart Sand is likely being undervalued right now.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/should-value-investors-buy-charles-river-associates-crai-stock-1","Article":"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\nOf these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\nOne company to watch right now is Charles River Associates (CRAI). CRAI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P\/E ratio of 20.77, which compares to its industry's average of 23.85. Over the last 12 months, CRAI's Forward P\/E has been as high as 28.96 and as low as 20.23, with a median of 25.02.\nInvestors will also notice that CRAI has a PEG ratio of 1.30. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P\/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CRAI's industry has an average PEG of 1.76 right now. Within the past year, CRAI's PEG has been as high as 1.81 and as low as 1.26, with a median of 1.56.\nInvestors should also recognize that CRAI has a P\/B ratio of 5.29. Investors use the P\/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P\/B looks solid versus its industry's average P\/B of 6.56. CRAI's P\/B has been as high as 6.85 and as low as 4.62, with a median of 5.88, over the past year.\nValue investors also frequently use the P\/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CRAI has a P\/S ratio of 1.61. This compares to its industry's average P\/S of 1.75.\nFinally, our model also underscores that CRAI has a P\/CF ratio of 15.42. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. CRAI's P\/CF compares to its industry's average P\/CF of 17.78. Within the past 12 months, CRAI's P\/CF has been as high as 20.36 and as low as 14.38, with a median of 17.49.\nThese are only a few of the key metrics included in Charles River Associates's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, CRAI looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/should-value-investors-buy-brf-brfs-stock-9","Article":"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.\nOf these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nIn addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with \"A\" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.\nOne stock to keep an eye on is BRF (BRFS). BRFS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P\/E ratio of 10.62. This compares to its industry's average Forward P\/E of 15.85. Over the last 12 months, BRFS's Forward P\/E has been as high as 23.56 and as low as 7.25, with a median of 10.47.\nAnother valuation metric that we should highlight is BRFS's P\/B ratio of 1.24. The P\/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P\/B looks attractive against its industry's average P\/B of 1.96. Over the past year, BRFS's P\/B has been as high as 1.62 and as low as 1.07, with a median of 1.33.\nFinally, we should also recognize that BRFS has a P\/CF ratio of 4.56. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P\/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P\/CF of 13.89. Over the past year, BRFS's P\/CF has been as high as 12.14 and as low as 4, with a median of 5.98.\nThese figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that BRF is likely being undervalued right now.

It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $12.32 billion, exhibiting a decline of 3.2% compared to the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has undergone a downward revision of 2.1% in the past 30 days, bringing it to its present level. This represents how the covering analysts, as a whole, have reassessed their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Intel metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net Revenues- Total Intel Products Group- Client Computing Group' will reach $6.86 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -9%.\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Revenues- Total Intel Products Group- Network and Edge' to reach $1.41 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +3.1% from the prior-year quarter.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Net Revenues- Total Intel Products Group- Data Center and AI' will reach $2.97 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2%.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Net Revenues- Intel Foundry Services' at $4.25 billion. The estimate points to a change of -2.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Net Revenues- All other- Mobileye' will reach $449.28 million. The estimate suggests a change of +88% year over year.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net Revenues- All other- Other' of $140.08 million. The estimate points to a change of -27.8% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for Intel here>>>\n\nIntel shares have witnessed a change of -21% in the past month, in contrast to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% move.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Marvell Technology (MRVL) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nMarvell currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.19, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 31 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.19 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 31 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 27 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.1% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for MRVL\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Marvell here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Marvell, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nShould You Invest in MRVL?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Marvell, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $2.76.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marvell.

NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/why-investing-sp-500-might-be-no-brainer-move-right-now","Article":"It may seem like a bad time to invest in the stock market due to the uncertainty ahead, but it may actually be a no-brainer to do so right now. While the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is down roughly 10% in 2025 as of Thursday's prices, historically, it has risen in value.\nThe index is designed to track 500 of the best publicly traded stocks on the market. And by investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the broad index, long-term investors have an easy way to benefit from the market's growth over the years.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\nHere's how you can easily invest in an S&P 500 ETF, and why you should consider doing so today.\nAn easy way to track the index\nThere are many ETFs available that can help you track the S&P 500. One of the most popular options is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: SPY). It has a low expense ratio of 0.09%, and its total returns (which include dividends) over the past 10 years have been nearly identical to those of the index.\n^SPX data by YCharts\nAs you can see, investing in the ETF over the long haul has allowed investors to generate some great returns, while enjoying a lot of diversification and taking on minimal risk. A $10,000 investment in the fund over this time frame would have grown to some $30,000 -- and that's even when you factor in the market's decline this year.\nBut often, when prices rise too quickly, market forces can bring them down back to reality.\nWere stocks overdue for a decline?\nThe S&P 500 has historically averaged annual returns of around 10%. That's just an average, however, and there will be both good and bad years mixed in along the way. For example, in 2024 and 2023, the index rose by more than 20% -- well above its long-run average. And that propelled it to a higher-than-typical valuation.\nThe cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, also known as CAPE, looks at a 10-year period to help gauge how cheap or expensive the stock market is. And prior to the market sell-off this year, the CAPE ratio was up around 37. The last time it was that high was back in 2021, just before the following year's crash in the markets, when the S&P 500 would decline by more than 19%.\nThe CAPE ratio is down to 33 now. And while that's still high, it suggests that stocks are not as egregiously overvalued as they were at the beginning of the year. That doesn't guarantee that more of a decline won't be coming this year, but investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF when valuations are more modest can help investors secure better returns over the long run.\nWhy buying on a time of weakness is a good idea\nThe market was arguably overdue for a decline heading into this year, given its impressive performance heading into 2025, and buying at elevated levels may have been risky due to the potential for a correction.\nWhile you don't necessarily want to time the markets, it's generally a good idea to invest in the S&P 500 at a time of weakness, simply because it can lead to far better returns in the long haul than if you bought when its valuation was at record levels. Even though stocks may still fall this year, investing in the S&P 500 right now can be a great move for long-term investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust wasn’t one of them.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/why-citizens-financial-services-czfs-top-dividend-stock-your-portfolio","Article":"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\nCitizens Financial Services in Focus\nCitizens Financial Services (CZFS) is headquartered in Mansfield, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -11.69% since the start of the year. The bank is paying out a dividend of $0.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.54% compared to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 3.2% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nLooking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.98 is up 1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Citizens Financial Services has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 2.52%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Citizens Financial Services's payout ratio is 32%, which means it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nEarnings growth looks solid for CZFS for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $6.40 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 6.49%.\nBottom Line\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, CZFS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\nVGM Score\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\nAs mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: Tyson Foods (TSN)\nHeadquartered in Arkansas, Tyson Foods Inc. was founded in 1935.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/what-makes-live-nation-lyv-new-buy-stock","Article":"Live Nation (LYV) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\nIndividual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.\nTherefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Live Nation basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor Live Nation, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Live Nation\nThis ticket seller and concert promoter is expected to earn $2.70 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2025, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.5%.\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Live Nation. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 10.9%.\nBottom Line\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\nThe upgrade of Live Nation to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/what-makes-babcock-international-group-bckiy-good-fit-trend-investing","Article":"Most of us have heard the dictum \"the trend is your friend.\" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it.\nOften, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.\nInvestors looking to make a profit from stocks that are currently on the move may find our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen pretty useful. This predefined screen comes handy in spotting stocks that are on an uptrend backed by strength in their fundamentals, and trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.\nBabcock International Group PLC\n(BCKIY) is one of the several suitable candidates that passed through the screen. Here are the key reasons why it could be a profitable bet for \"trend\" investors.\nA solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. BCKIY is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 64.2% over this period.\nHowever, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 4% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company.\nMoreover, BCKIY is currently trading at 97.5% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.\nLooking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nAnother factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.\nSo, the price trend in BCKIY may not reverse anytime soon.\nIn addition to BCKIY, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our \"Recent Price Strength\" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.\nThis is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.\nHowever, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past. You could easily do that with the help of the Zacks Research Wizard.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/what-could-happen-tesla-stock-if-elon-musk-sold-company","Article":"This was supposed to be Elon Musk’s year of triumph, though with the way it is going so far, 2025 might go down as a huge bump in the world’s richest man’s career. Between the chaos of running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the economy going up and down, and controversy over Musk’s place as an unelected government official, it’s possible Musk might look to make some changes.\nRead Next: Time To Panic? What Experts Advise for Tesla Investors Amid Stock Slide\nFind Out: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nHow this could manifest is anyone’s guess — however, it could include the selling of Musk’s groundbreaking electric vehicle company, Tesla, which has been declining in the stock market and formed a “death cross” on April 14, Barron’s reported.\nIf Musk were to decide to sell Tesla — which he has not indicated an intention to do — this could either let the company bounce back into the market with a new reputation, or it could sink it forever.\nGOBankingRates asked financial experts what might happen to Tesla stock if Elon Musk sold the company. Here is what they predicted could happen.\nMarket Restabilization\nThere’s a chance that Musk has simply become too controversial a figure to continue to run and oversee Tesla. Selling the company could give the company a wash in the public eye, leading to a restabilization on the markets and the faith of investors.\n“Tesla investors and the public see the company as more stable and more focused on business rather than politics, contributing to internal optimism and increased external investment,” said Javier Palomarez, the founder and CEO of the United States Hispanic Business Council (USHBC).\nIn Palomarez’s professional opinion, investors could find less reasons to panic if Musk started to refocus on business instead of politics again. Additionally, if Musk did cash out all of his investments and sever all ties with Tesla, the company might find stabilization again, courting investors both new and old.\nLearn More: Elon Musk’s Net Worth Takes a Hit Amid Tesla Boycott: What’s Next?\nDrop in Value\nPalomarez said Tesla investors and the public see Elon Musk as someone that has lost his position of influence within the government.\nAccording to Palomarez, if Musk does not sell Tesla, regulators could begin to target him and his company for political reasons, pointing out how the current public scrutiny with his involvement in federal contracting could come back to hurt Tesla in the future.\n“If Tesla is unable to find a suitable replacement [for Musk] their value will drop,” added Palomarez, noting that while it is possible to find another charismatic leader, it will be hard to match Musk’s talent for marketing, innovation and leadership.\nComplete Disaster\n“If Musk jumps ship, which he won’t, Tesla’s stock explodes like a lithium battery torched on the fourth of July,” said U.S. investor and finance expert Eric Schiffer of Reputation Management Consultants. “It’s like ripping out the brain and heart and expecting the patient to still function.”\nSchiffer explained, “Investors buy Musk’s vision and brain; without him, they’re left holding stock in the Hindenburg. You would see a violent and ugly shareholder bloodbath leveled at the stock.”\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/what-bitcoin-indicators-predict-q3-2025","Article":"Bitcoin Magazine\n\nWhat Bitcoin Indicators Predict for Q3 2025?\nBitcoin’s 2025 journey hasn’t delivered the explosive bull market surge many expected. After peaking above $100,000, the 2025 Bitcoin price retraced sharply to as low as $75,000, sparking debate among investors and analysts about where we stand in the Bitcoin cycle. In this analysis, we cut through the noise, leveraging on-chain indicators and macro data to determine if the Bitcoin bull market remains intact or if a deeper Bitcoin correction looms in Q3 2025. Key metrics like MVRV Z-Score, Value Days Destroyed (VDD), and Bitcoin capital flows provide critical insights into the market’s next move.\nIs Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback Healthy or Bull Cycle End?\nA strong starting point for assessing the 2025 Bitcoin cycle is the MVRV Z-Score, a trusted on-chain indicator that compares market value to realized value. After hitting 3.36 at Bitcoin’s $100,000 peak, the MVRV Z-Score dropped to 1.43, aligning with the 2025 Bitcoin price decline from $100,000 to $75,000. This 30% Bitcoin correction may seem alarming, but recent data shows the MVRV Z-Score rebounding from its 2025 low of 1.43.\nFigure 1: The MVRV Z-Score reflects a potential local bottom in the 2025 Bitcoin cycle. [View Live Chart]\nHistorically, MVRV Z-Score levels around 1.43 have marked local bottoms, not tops, in prior Bitcoin bull markets (e.g., 2017 and 2021). These Bitcoin pullbacks often preceded resumed uptrends, suggesting the current correction aligns with healthy bull cycle dynamics. While investor confidence is shaken, this move fits historical patterns of Bitcoin market cycles.\nHow Smart Money Shapes the 2025 Bitcoin Bull Market\nThe Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple, another critical on-chain indicator, tracks the velocity of BTC transactions weighted by holding periods. Spikes in VDD signal profit-taking by experienced holders, while low levels indicate Bitcoin accumulation. Currently, VDD is in the “green zone,” mirroring levels seen in late bear markets or early bull market recoveries.\nFigure 2: The VDD Multiple highlights long-term Bitcoin accumulation in 2025. [View Live Chart]\nFollowing Bitcoin’s reversal from $100,000, the low VDD suggests the end of a profit-taking phase, with long-term holders accumulating in anticipation of higher 2025 Bitcoin prices. The Bitcoin Cycle Capital Flows chart further illuminates this trend, breaking down realized capital by coin age. Near the $106,000 peak, new market entrants (<1 month) drove a spike in activity, signaling FOMO-driven buying. Since the Bitcoin pullback, this group’s activity has cooled to levels typical of early-to-mid bull markets.\nIn contrast, the 1–2 year cohort—often macro-savvy Bitcoin investors—is increasing activity, accumulating at lower prices. This shift mirrors Bitcoin accumulation patterns from 2020 and 2021, where long-term holders bought during dips, setting the stage for bull cycle rallies.\nFigure 3: Bitcoin Cycle Capital Flows show BTC moving to experienced holders in 2025. [View Live Chart]\nWhere Are We in the 2025 Bitcoin Market Cycle?\nZooming out, the Bitcoin market cycle can be divided into three phases:\nBear phase: Deep Bitcoin corrections of 70–90%.\nRecovery phase: Reclaiming prior all-time highs.\nBull\/exponential phase: Parabolic Bitcoin price advances.\nPast bear markets (2015, 2018) lasted 13–14 months, and the most recent Bitcoin bear market followed suit at 14 months. Recovery phases typically span 23–26 months, and the current 2025 Bitcoin cycle falls within this range. However, unlike past bull markets, Bitcoin’s breakout above previous highs was followed by a pullback rather than an immediate surge.\nFigure 4: Historical Bitcoin cycle trends project a Q3 2025 bull peak.\nThis Bitcoin pullback may signal a higher low, setting up the exponential phase of the 2025 bull market. Based on past cycles’ 9–11-month exponential phases, the Bitcoin price could peak around September 2025, assuming the bull cycle resumes.\nMacro Risks Impacting Bitcoin Price in Q3 2025\nDespite bullish on-chain indicators, macro headwinds pose risks to the 2025 Bitcoin price. The S&P 500 vs. Bitcoin Correlation chart shows Bitcoin remains tightly linked to U.S. equities. With fears of a global recession growing, weakness in traditional markets could cap Bitcoin’s near-term rally potential.\nFigure 5: Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities in 2025. [View Live Chart]\nMonitoring these macro risks is crucial, as a deteriorating equity market could trigger a deeper Bitcoin correction in Q3 2025, even if on-chain data remains supportive.\nConclusion: Bitcoin’s Q3 2025 Outlook\nKey on-chain indicators—MVRV Z-Score, Value Days Destroyed, and Bitcoin Cycle Capital Flows—point to healthy, cycle-consistent behavior and long-term holder accumulation in the 2025 Bitcoin cycle. While slower and uneven compared to past bull markets, the current cycle aligns with historical Bitcoin market cycle structures. If macro conditions stabilize, Bitcoin appears poised for another leg up, potentially peaking in Q3 or Q4 2025.\nHowever, macro risks, including equity market volatility and recession fears, remain critical to watch.

Analysts forecast revenues of $4.39 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% year over year.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Ameriprise metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\nAnalysts expect 'Revenues- Net investment income' to come in at $845.60 million. The estimate points to a change of -6.2% from the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Revenues- Premiums, policy and contract charges' reaching $391.68 million. The estimate points to a change of +0.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- Distribution fees' will reach $534.87 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.7%.\nAnalysts forecast 'Revenues- Other revenues' to reach $132.12 million. The estimate suggests a change of +2.4% year over year.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Total Assets Under Management' will reach $1.18 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $1.13 billion in the same quarter last year.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Total Assets Under Administration' at $317.49 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $297.46 million in the same quarter last year.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Total assets Under Management and Administration' should come in at $1.49 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $1.42 billion.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Total Assets Under Management - Asset Management AUM' should arrive at $646.27 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $652.08 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'AWM - Total Wrap Accounts - Total wrap ending assets' of $576.78 billion. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $521.72 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Total Assets Under Management - Advice & Wealth Management AUM' stands at $575.34 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $518.08 million.\nAnalysts predict that the 'AWM - Total Client Assets (at period end)' will reach $1,030.12 billion. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $953.77 billion.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Number of total advisors' will likely reach 10,450. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 10,364.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for Ameriprise here>>>\n\nShares of Ameriprise have experienced a change of -5.8% in the past month compared to the -6.9% move of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/why-investors-need-take-advantage-these-2-consumer-staples-stocks-now-14","Article":"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.\nThe earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.\nThe ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information.\nWith this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.\nIn fact, when we combined a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Perhaps most importantly, using these parameters has helped produce 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\nStocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.\nShould You Consider Estee Lauder?\nThe final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Estee Lauder (EL) earns a #3 (Hold) 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 1, 2025, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.34 a share.\nEL has an Earnings ESP figure of +14.31%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.34 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30. Estee Lauder is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nEL is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Tyson Foods (TSN) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\nTyson Foods, which is readying to report earnings on May 5, 2025, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.87 a share, and TSN is 17 days out from its next earnings report.\nFor Tyson Foods, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85 is +2.35%.\nBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, EL and TSN could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/why-jabil-jbl-top-value-stock-long-term-1","Article":"It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\nFeaturing daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nFor value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\nVGM Score\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nThe Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: Jabil (JBL)\nHeadquartered in St. Petersburg, FL, Jabil, Inc. is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services. The company offers electronics design, production, product management and after-market services to customers in the aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, storage and telecommunications industries.\nJBL is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P\/E ratio of 15.07; value investors should take notice.\nThree analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.18 to $8.96 per share. JBL boasts an average earnings surprise of 4.9%.\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, JBL should be on investors' short list.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/will-expedia-expe-beat-estimates-again-its-next-earnings-report-0","Article":"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Expedia (EXPE), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis online travel company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 7.98%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Expedia was expected to post earnings of $2.07 per share, but it reported $2.39 per share instead, representing a surprise of 15.46%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.10 per share, while it actually produced $6.13 per share, a surprise of 0.49%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nFor Expedia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nExpedia currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.58%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 8, 2025.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/worried-about-how-tariffs-will-affect-your-portfolio-look-stocks-have-1-super","Article":"The stock market has been whipsawing as a result of new tariff announcements that add more complexity and uncertainty to the mix. While it appears as though President Donald Trump is enacting a more stabilizing approach with a temporary pause in place and exemptions for certain products coming into the U.S., investors are probably wondering about ways to protect their portfolios for whatever the future holds.\nIf you're worried about tariffs, it might be a good idea to identify stocks that possess this one phenomenal trait.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\nProviding a tariff buffer\nImplementing tariffs basically increases costs that businesses face. The biggest fear among economists is that this will lead to inflationary pressures, as the higher costs are passed to consumers in the form of higher prices. People might already be aware of this possibility, as their expectations about the economy in the short term are at a 12-year low.\nWhile the ultimate effect of tariffs is unknown, with what seems like more questions than answers at this point, investors can focus their attention on ways of upgrading their portfolios. Maybe it's time to add stocks that provide a tariff buffer.\nWarren Buffett, the great investor who has compounded capital at a remarkable rate for Berkshire Hathaway, once said that pricing power is a characteristic of a wonderful business. Companies that can occasionally ask customers to pay more without worrying about losing them are in fantastic shape.\nApply this thinking to the current economic landscape. To be fair, no business can raise prices without limit. However, there are companies that have proven their pricing power. Coca-Cola, the beverage giant with a global presence, consistently raises prices on its products, betting that customers will stay loyal to the brand. This can offset muted unit volume growth.\nApple sells expensive devices that seem to always be in demand. Beautifully designed hardware mixed with easy-to-use software is a winning combination. Manufacturing supercars is an incredibly lucrative endeavor for Ferrari. It offers vehicles that are basically viewed as collector's items, with perhaps the strongest pricing power out there.\nInvestors might not think Costco Wholesale has pricing power because of its intense focus on selling merchandise at extremely low prices. But look at the company's growing membership base that just accepted an annual fee hike last year. Netflix also has pricing power. The leadership team of the top video streamer has consistently increased subscription fees, especially in the U.S. and Canada. This hasn't prevented membership growth over the years.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nPatience is a virtue\nCoca-Cola, Apple, Ferrari, Costco, and Netflix are simply examples of companies that have historically increased prices on occasion. It would make sense for the everyday investor to at least understand and appreciate pricing power, particularly within the current uncertain macro backdrop.\nIt's important to keep in mind that these five stocks don't necessarily present smart buying opportunities right now. Valuation is a critical component that needs to be factored into the decision-making process. Pay too much, and returns could be disappointing.\nWith that in mind, all these stocks arguably trade at expensive price-to-earnings ratios. What's more, new developments surrounding tariffs could have more of a negative effect on some of these companies compared to others.\nIf valuation is less of a concern for you, then maybe it's best to dollar-cost average into shares of Coca-Cola, Apple, Ferrari, Costco, Netflix, or any other companies with pricing power, over a 12-month span, for instance. This helps ensure that your portfolio consists of businesses that can pass higher costs to customers. It can also be beneficial to take advantage of many different price points when buying shares.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, Stock Advisor’s total average return is 792%* — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 153% for the S&P 500.\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now, available when you join Stock Advisor.\nSee the stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 14, 2025\nNeil Patel and his clients have no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Moody's (MCO), which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this credit ratings agency has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.92%, on average, in the last two quarters.\nFor the most recent quarter, Moody's was expected to post earnings of $2.60 per share, but it reported $2.62 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.77%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.89 per share, while it actually produced $3.21 per share, a surprise of 11.07%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Moody's lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nMoody's currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.09%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 22, 2025.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This company, which is in the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis homebuilder has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 59.55%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Meritage was expected to post earnings of $2.21 per share, but it reported $4.72 per share instead, representing a surprise of 113.57%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.53 per share, while it actually produced $2.67 per share, a surprise of 5.53%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nFor Meritage, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nMeritage currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 23, 2025.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\nUnitil in Focus\nHeadquartered in Hampton, Unitil (UTL) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 8.36% so far this year. The utility is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.45 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.07%. This compares to the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield of 3.05% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nLooking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.80 is up 5.9% from last year. In the past five-year period, Unitil has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 3.51%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unitil's current payout ratio is 58%. This means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nLooking at this fiscal year, UTL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $3.08 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 3.70%.\nBottom Line\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\nFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UTL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/why-navient-navi-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again","Article":"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Navient (NAVI). This company, which is in the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis student loan servicing company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 23.37%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Navient came out with earnings of $0.25 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20 per share, representing a surprise of 25%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.23 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.28 per share, delivering a surprise of 21.74%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nFor Navient, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNavient currently has an Earnings ESP of +56.34%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 30, 2025.\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Veeva Systems (VEEV).\nVeeva currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.97, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.97 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 51.9% and 11.1% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for VEEV\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Veeva here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Veeva, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs VEEV Worth Investing In?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Veeva, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.5% over the past month to $7.30.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Veeva. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Veeva may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/wall-street-analysts-see-76418-upside-corbus-pharmaceuticals-crbp-can-stock-really-move","Article":"Corbus Pharmaceuticals (CRBP) closed the last trading session at $6.03, gaining 0.5% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $52.11 indicates a 764.2% upside potential.\nThe mean estimate comprises nine short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $12.31. While the lowest estimate of $35 indicates a 480.4% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 1110.6% to reach $73. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\nWhile the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.\nBut, for CRBP, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\nHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\nHere's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in CRBP\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision.\nMoreover, CRBP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much CRBP could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund.\nAdditional Research Links\nTop NASDAQ 100 Stocks\nTop Technology Stocks\nTop Large-Cap Growth Stocks\nHigh Momentum Stocks\nTop Chip Stocks\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

(PAGS) and Shift4 Payments (FOUR). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nPagSeguro Digital Ltd. and Shift4 Payments are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that PAGS's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nPAGS currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 6.85, while FOUR has a forward P\/E of 16.18. We also note that PAGS has a PEG ratio of 0.61. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P\/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FOUR currently has a PEG ratio of 0.62.\nAnother notable valuation metric for PAGS is its P\/B ratio of 1.03. The P\/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FOUR has a P\/B of 6.72.\nBased on these metrics and many more, PAGS holds a Value grade of B, while FOUR has a Value grade of C.\nPAGS stands above FOUR thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PAGS is the superior value option right now.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis asset management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.1%.\nRevenues are expected to be $201.39 million, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Virtus?\nFor Virtus, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Virtus will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Virtus would post earnings of $7.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.50, delivering a surprise of +0.27%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nVirtus doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) is soon expected to post earnings of $9.12 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +8.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.39 billion, up 7.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Ameriprise has been revised 3.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.04%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Ameriprise will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, consolidated net income was $5,297,000, or $0.64 per diluted share (EPS). This compared to consolidated net income of $6,008,000, or $0.73 EPS, for the prior quarter and $5,727,000, or $0.69 EPS, for the same period a year ago.\n\n\nThe net income decrease compared to prior periods was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses.\n\n\nNet interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $17,807,000, compared to $17,846,000 in the prior quarter, and $17,241,000 in the same period a year ago. The decrease from the prior quarter is attributable to a Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) rate cut in December-2024 that lowered the yield on certain variable rate assets, and there were 2 fewer days of interest accruals. In spite of the December-2024 FOMC rate cut, the net interest margin increased to 4.09% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 4.00% for the prior quarter and 4.09% for the same period last year, partially due to a decline in deposit interest expense. Average cost of funds decreased to 0.79% as of March 31, 2025, compared to 0.86% for the prior quarter and increased from 0.68% for the first quarter of 2024. The higher average gross loan balance, and upward repricing of loan yields also contributed to the increase in earning asset yield and net interest margin.\n\n\nNon-interest income was $1,613,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to $1,430,000 for the prior quarter and $1,519,000 for the same period last year. The increase compared to prior periods was mainly due to positive changes in the fair value of equity securities.\n\n\nNon-interest expense totaled $12,624,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to $11,548,000 in the previous quarter and $11,529,000 in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in non-interest expense compared to prior periods corresponds primarily to staffing expenses and general operating costs related to servicing the growing loan and deposit portfolios.\n\n\nTotal assets were $1.92 billion at March 31, 2025, an increase of $23.8 million and $118.6 million from December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Gross loans were $1.09 billion at March 31, 2025, a decrease of $15.6 million and an increase of $51.4 million over December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The Company’s total deposits were $1.71 billion at March 31, 2025, an increase of $17.9 million and $101.2 million from December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Our liquidity position remains strong, as evidenced by $209.3 million in cash and cash equivalents balances at March 31, 2025, representing an increase of $40.5 million over December 31, 2024.\n\n\n“Our balance sheet remains strong and although we’ve seen modest loan paydowns this quarter, it represents a very small reduction in gross loans and compares favorably to what we generally expect for the beginning of the year,” stated Chris Courtney, CEO. \"We remain committed to delivering steady growth while maintaining a conservative approach to risk management.\"\n\n\nNon-performing assets (“NPA”) remained at zero as of March 31, 2025, as they were as of December 31, 2024, and March 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) as a percentage of gross loans was 1.05% at March 31, 2025, compared to 1.04% at December 31, 2024 and 1.05% at March 31, 2024. Given industry concerns of credit risk specific to commercial real estate, management has performed a thorough analysis of this segment as part of the CECL credit risk model’s ACL computation, concluding that the credit loss reserve relative to gross loans remains at acceptable levels, and credit quality remains stable.\n\n\nOak Valley Bancorp operates Oak Valley Community Bank & their Eastern Sierra Community Bank division, through which it offers a variety of loan and deposit products to individuals and small businesses. They currently operate through 18 conveniently located branches: Oakdale, Turlock, Stockton, Patterson, Ripon, Escalon, Manteca, Tracy, Sacramento, Roseville, two branches in Sonora, three branches in Modesto, and three branches in their Eastern Sierra division, which includes Bridgeport, Mammoth Lakes, and Bishop. The Company will open its 19\n\nth\n\nbranch location in Lodi later this year.\n\n\nFor more information, call 1-866-844-7500 or visit\n\n\nwww.ovcb.com\n\n\n.\n\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements about the corporation for which the corporation claims the protection of safe harbor provisions contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\n\nForward-looking statements are based on management's knowledge and belief as of today and include information concerning the corporation's possible or assumed future financial condition, and its results of operations and business.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/comcast-cmcsa-q1-earnings-horizon-analysts-insights-key-performance-measures","Article":"The upcoming report from Comcast (CMCSA) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share, indicating a decline of 5.8% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $29.68 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% year over year.\nOver the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 1.4% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Comcast metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Residential Connectivity & Platforms- Domestic Wireless' should arrive at $1.16 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +19.3% year over year.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- Content & Experiences- Theme Parks' will reach $1.92 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -3.1% from the prior-year quarter.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenue- Content & Experiences- Media' should come in at $6.37 billion. The estimate points to a change of -0.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Residential Connectivity & Platforms- Video' at $6.47 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6%.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Domestic Broadband - Residential Customers' reaching 29.25 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 29.69 million in the same quarter last year.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Domestic Broadband - Business Customers' will reach 2.46 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 2.5 million in the same quarter last year.\nAnalysts forecast 'Total Domestic Video Customers' to reach 12.13 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 13.62 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Total Domestic Broadband Customers' will reach 31.71 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 32.19 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Customer relationships - Domestic Residential Connectivity & Platforms Customer Relationships' will likely reach 31.04 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 31.56 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Customer relationships - International Residential Connectivity & Platforms Customer Relationships' of 17.77 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 17.78 million.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Customer relationships - Business Services Connectivity Customer Relationships' stands at 2.62 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 2.63 million.\nAnalysts expect 'Customer relationships - Total Connectivity & Platforms Customer Relationships' to come in at 51.44 million.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/colgate-palmolive-cl-reports-next-week-what-awaits","Article":"Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.\nRevenues are expected to be $4.88 billion, down 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate-Palmolive?\nFor Colgate-Palmolive, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.79%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Colgate-Palmolive will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Colgate-Palmolive would post earnings of $0.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.91, delivering a surprise of +2.25%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nColgate-Palmolive doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry, Procter & Gamble (PG) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.54 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $20.34 billion, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for P&G has been revised 0.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.97%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that P&G will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL)?\nBefore you invest in Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

(NYSE: COHR), a global leader in photonics, today announces the launch of the\n\nAxon FL\n\n, a fiber coupling module that transforms the Axon 920 TPC ultrafast femtosecond laser into a plug-and-play solution for Mini2P microscopy. Designed for seamless interchangeability between free-space and fiber-coupled outputs, the Axon FL significantly expands the versatility of the Axon 920 TPC laser, enabling researchers to use a single source across a wider range of applications, such as exploring intricate neural circuits and cellular dynamics deep within living tissues.\n\n\nMini2P microscopy is rapidly gaining momentum for in vivo brain imaging in freely moving animals, and the demand for reliable femtosecond laser delivery via fiber is growing. Until now, researchers lacked a direct, commercial solution to connect the Axon 920 TPC to Mini2P setups. The Axon FL bridges that gap—delivering high-quality, clean femtosecond pulses through standard FC\/PC connectors and offering high contrast power control with dynamic group delay dispersion (GDD) tuning for precise optimization.\n\n\n“The Axon FL unlocks a new level of flexibility for labs already using the Axon 920 TPC,” said Dr. Chris Dorman, Executive Vice President, Lasers Business Group at Coherent. “Its modular design, precision alignment, and cost-effective upgrade path offer unmatched convenience and performance for Mini2P users.”\n\n\nUnlike competing systems, the Axon FL is available as an accessory, making it a smart, economical choice for existing users. With robust compatibility and precision-engineered alignment features, it sets a new benchmark in fiber-coupled laser performance for the neuroscience community.\n\n\n\nAbout Coherent\n\n\n\nCoherent empowers market innovators to define the future through breakthrough technologies, from materials to systems.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain - Unsponsored ADR and James Hardie are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now.

But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\nCODYY currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 13.27, while JHX has a forward P\/E of 14.17. We also note that CODYY has a PEG ratio of 2.73. This metric is used similarly to the famous P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. JHX currently has a PEG ratio of 4.54.\nAnother notable valuation metric for CODYY is its P\/B ratio of 1.80. The P\/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, JHX has a P\/B of 4.60.\nBased on these metrics and many more, CODYY holds a Value grade of B, while JHX has a Value grade of D.\nCODYY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/chewy-chwy-trending-stock-facts-know-betting-it-2","Article":"Chewy (CHWY) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this online pet store have returned +9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Chewy belongs, has lost 13.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Chewy is expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share, indicating a change of +9.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $1.23 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.3%. This estimate has changed -2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.52 indicates a change of +23.3% from what Chewy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Chewy.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Chewy, the consensus sales estimate of $3.07 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.8%. The $12.4 billion and $13.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.5% and +6.7%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nChewy reported revenues of $3.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.9%. EPS of $0.28 for the same period compares with $0.18 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.6%. The EPS surprise was +33.33%.\nOver the last four quarters, Chewy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nChewy is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Chewy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/charter-communications-chtr-earnings-expected-grow-what-know-ahead-next-weeks-release","Article":"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Charter Communications (CHTR) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.63 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.3%.\nRevenues are expected to be $13.66 billion, down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.31% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Charter?\nFor Charter, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.98%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Charter will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Charter would post earnings of $9.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $10.10, delivering a surprise of +5.87%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nCharter doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\nAnother stock from the Zacks Cable Television industry, Comcast (CMCSA), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $29.68 billion, down 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Comcast has been revised 1.4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.56%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Comcast will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in Charter Communications, Inc.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/century-cenx-upgraded-buy-heres-why","Article":"Century Aluminum (CENX) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Century is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor Century, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Century\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2025, this aluminum producer is expected to earn $3.80 per share, which is a change of 15.5% from the year-ago reported number.\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Century. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 37.7%.\nBottom Line\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\nThe upgrade of Century to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis healthcare company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%.\nRevenues are expected to be $43.47 billion, up 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.67% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Centene?\nFor Centene, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.85%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Centene will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Centene would post earnings of $0.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.80, delivering a surprise of +63.27%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, Molina (MOH) is soon expected to post earnings of $5.86 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +2.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $11.12 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Molina has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -17.79%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Molina will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/celestica-cls-considered-good-investment-brokers-true-0","Article":"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Celestica (CLS) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nCelestica currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.44, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by nine brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.44 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the nine recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 22.2% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CLS\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Celestica here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Celestica, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs CLS Worth Investing In?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Celestica, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.78.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Celestica. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Celestica.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\nCapital City Bank in Focus\nCapital City Bank (CCBG) is headquartered in Tallahassee, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -6.41% since the start of the year. The bank holding company is paying out a dividend of $0.24 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.8% compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.59% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $0.96 is up 9.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Capital City Bank has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Capital City Bank's payout ratio is 29%, which means it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nLooking at this fiscal year, CCBG expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $3.14 per share, with earnings expected to increase 0.64% from the year ago period.\nBottom Line\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that CCBG is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

Lam Research (LRCX), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis semiconductor equipment maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 6.05%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Lam Research was expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share, but it reported $0.91 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.60%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.80 per share, while it actually produced $0.86 per share, a surprise of 7.50%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nFor Lam Research, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nLam Research currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 23, 2025.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/bull-day-hims-hers-health-hims","Article":"Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) has emerged as a disruptive force in telehealth, leveraging technology and personalization to address highly-personal health conditions while achieving scalable profitability.\n\nHIMS (for short) is a significant player in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) telehealth industry, offering personalized healthcare solutions that encompass mental health, sexual wellness, dermatology, and chronic condition management -- some of which have been stigmatized and kept people from seeking solutions.\n\nWith a robust subscription-based model and a focus on accessibility, the company has demonstrated notable growth and resilience in a competitive landscape.\nHIMS' vertically-integrated platform, combining telehealth consultations, diagnostics, and pharmacy services, positions it to capitalize on the $100+ billion telehealth market while expanding into adjacent healthcare sectors.\n\nIn my Zacks Healthcare Innovators portfolio, we took a chance on this young company in August under $15. And the herd caught on in the new year, giving us a surge above $60 where were able to harvest a gain of 220% during that volatility spike.\n\nWe are long again and targeting an eventual return in the next 12-18 months to at least $50.\n\n2024 Was Great, 2025 Gets Better\n\nOn February 24, HIMS reported its Q4 and full-year results.\n\nRevenue of $1.5 billion was up 69% year-over-year in 2024. Revenue excluding their GLP-1 offering increased 43% year-over-year to over $1.2 billion in 2024, meeting the company's previous 2025 revenue target a year early.\n\nSubscribers grew to 2.2 million, up 45% year-over-year in 2024.\n\nNet income of $126 million and adjusted EBITDA of $177 million in 2024.\n\nHIMS provided full year 2025 guidance, with revenue in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion -- representing nearly 60% annual growth at the midpoint -- and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $270 million to $320 million.\n\nThis outlook prompted analysts to boost their estimates in the past few weeks, moving HIMS to a Zacks #2 Rank as the Zacks EPS Consensus among eight analysts jumped 38% from 52-cents to 72-cents -- representing explosive profit growth of 167%!\n\nLet's look through three windows on the fundamental outlook for HIMS.\n\n1) Core Revenue Streams\n\nThe company's primary revenue driver is its subscription-based model, accounting for over 90% of total revenue. As of Q4 2024, Hims & Hers reported 2.2 million subscribers, a 45% increase year-over-year. The average monthly online revenue per subscriber reached $73, reflecting 24% y-o-y growth.\n\nThe company operates five primary verticals:\n\nSexual Health: Treatments for erectile dysfunction and hair loss (30% of revenue)\n\nMental Health: Therapy and anxiety\/depression medications (25%)\n\nDermatology: Acne and skincare solutions (20%)\n\nWeight Management: Compounded GLP-1 therapies and metabolic health programs ($725M projected 2025 revenue). This has been the primary concern for investors with HIMS as the GLP-1 weight loss space is filled with volatility due to competition and falling margins.\n\nPrimary Care: Expanding into chronic condition management\n\nRevenue grew 69% YoY to $1.5B in 2024, with subscriptions (82% retention at 3+ months) driving predictable cash flow. The 2025 guidance of $2.3B-$2.4B revenue reflects 59% growth at the midpoint, emphasizing margin expansion over GLP-1 volume.\n\n2) Margin Profile & Unit Economics\n\nHims & Hers achieved profitability in 2024 with $126M net income and $177M adjusted EBITDA (11.8% margin). 2025 guidance suggests further margin improvement to 12.6% at the midpoint ($270M-$320M EBITDA), fueled by:\n\nOperational leverage: 45% subscriber growth to 2.2M with 33% higher annual revenue per customer ($668 vs. $495)\n\nVertical integration: Recent acquisitions of Trybe Labs (diagnostics) and a peptide manufacturing facility reduce reliance on third-party suppliers\n\nAutomation: AI-powered MedMatch system analyzes 50M+ data points to optimize treatment plans, reducing provider workload\n\nCustomer acquisition costs rose to $929 in 2024 but remain justified by 85% retention rates and $198M free cash flow\n\nOverall, Hims & Hers maintains strong financial metrics, with gross margins consistently between 80-83% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11-12%. The net profit margin improved to 4% in 2024, indicating efficient operational management. The company's return on invested capital (ROIC) stands at an impressive 88.9%, and the payback period for customer acquisition costs is typically under a year, underscoring the effectiveness of its business model.\n\n3) Unique Marketing Edge: Hip Channels & Creative Acquisition\n\nHims & Hers employs a sophisticated marketing strategy, heavily investing in digital advertising across platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which account for a significant portion of their marketing spend.\n\nThe company utilizes a proprietary customer segmentation algorithm with a 93% targeting accuracy, enhancing the efficiency of its marketing campaigns. Referral programs and personalized communication strategies further bolster customer engagement and retention.\nHIMS deploys a $150M annual marketing budget across 3 strategies...\n\nMicro-Influencers: 1,200+ nano\/mid-tier creators driving 35% of conversions through relatable content\n\nBrand Campaigns: Super Bowl ads and billboards normalize conversations about sensitive health issues\n\nAlgorithmic Targeting: Proprietary AI matches ad creative to high-intent audiences, achieving 6:1 ROAS (return on ad spend) which is very strong\n\nThis approach enables cost-effective scaling in a sector where traditional healthcare providers spend 2-3x more per acquisition.\n\nAdapting to the Market\n\nThe global telehealth market is projected to reach over $250 billion by 2030, driven by increasing demand for virtual healthcare services. Hims & Hers' focus on areas like mental health, sexual wellness, and chronic condition management positions it to capture a significant share of this expanding market.\n\nThe company's foray into compounded GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, such as semaglutide, contributed to substantial revenue growth in 2024. However, recent FDA regulations ending the shortage status of these drugs have mandated the cessation of their compounded versions, posing a challenge to this revenue stream. Hims & Hers is adapting by focusing on personalized dosing models and diversifying its product portfolio to mitigate this impact.\n\nBottom line: Given these challenges, HIMS is still expecting explosive growth in their core businesses as they serve changing health-consumer preferences. The stock is a buy under $30 as it trades under 2.5x forward sales estimates.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/brokers-suggest-investing-celsius-celh-read-placing-bet-0","Article":"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Celsius Holdings Inc. (CELH) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nCelsius currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.56, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 18 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.56 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 18 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 72.2% and 5.6% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for CELH\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Celsius here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Celsius, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs CELH Worth Investing In?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Celsius, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 9.6% over the past month to $1.05.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Celsius. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Celsius may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

Look no further than the past couple of weeks. The Trump Administration's tariff announcement and ongoing posturing with other countries has sent stocks tumbling to some dramatic declines.\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) slid nearly 40% off its late-2024 highs, its sharpest decline in the past 10 years outside the time the market crashed at the onset of COVID-19 in early 2020. Now, the stock has bounced off its recent low. Should investors buy Broadcom now?\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\nHere is what you need to know.\nBuying Broadcom's last dramatic decline worked out well\nHistory has shown that when the stock market panics, it tends to be a good buying opportunity. The reason for panic tends to change, but investors are humans with emotions, and sometimes, the pendulum can swing too far in one direction. Tariff fears may have caused a panic this time, but it was COVID-19 back in 2020.\nThe stock market plummeted. Broadcom's stock price fell almost 50%. It's not fun buying stocks in these moments. Yet, those who held their nose and invested in the semiconductor and software giant made a lot of money. Broadcom has risen over 800% from March 2020 to today:\nAVGO data by YCharts\nIt's important to remember that this isn't the case with every stock in a market downturn. A bear market can flush out low-quality companies and cause permanent losses for investors. Broadcom, an industry leader in semiconductors for networking and communications, is an excellent business and bounced back after the pandemic.\nThe company's growth outlook has improved with AI\nBroadcom has thrived over the past decade, primarily due to growth in its core semiconductor business, which specializes in chips for networking and other communications applications. It then diversified its business with acquisitions, establishing infrastructure solutions as about 40% of its business. This segment sells products and services like cybersecurity, software for enterprise mainframes, and private cloud computing.\nThe arrival of artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited growth in the semiconductor industry. AI models require immense computing power to train and function. Broadcom is carving out its share of this market. It is developing custom accelerator chips (XPUs) for several large companies investing in building AI infrastructure, known as AI hyperscalers.\nManagement estimates that deals with three hyperscalers alone will represent a $60 billion to $90 billion revenue opportunity in 2027. Broadcom's AI-related chip revenue was $12.2 billion in 2024, so realizing anywhere near that opportunity will drive significant growth over the next several years. Analysts estimate the company will grow earnings by an average of nearly 21% annually over the next three to five years.\nShould you buy the stock? Why Broadcom may struggle to replicate history\nBroadcom's strong growth outlook and recent decline would seemingly signal investors to buy, but not so fast.\nRemember how I said the pendulum can swing too far? Well, it happened again, but in the other direction. The market has rallied hard on AI enthusiasm for the past two years. As stock valuations rise, prices start reflecting more future growth. Broadcom's price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio has increased from 32 in March 2020 to 86 today. The stock price increased over 800%, but earnings did not.\nAt a PEG ratio of 4, Broadcom's price is too high, even for a business growing earnings by 21% annually. I typically buy high-quality stocks at PEG ratios up to 2 to 2.5. As you go higher, the risks increase that things will go wrong. Perhaps Broadcom won't grow as fast as hoped, or the market and stock valuations will broadly decline.\nBroadcom is still an excellent business, but overpaying for stocks, even great companies, usually backfires more often than it works out.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/brixmor-property-brx-could-be-great-choice-2","Article":"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\nBrixmor Property in Focus\nBased in New York, Brixmor Property (BRX) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -8.26%. The owner and operator of shopping centers is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.29 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.5%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.64% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.15 is up 5.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Brixmor Property has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.71%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Brixmor's current payout ratio is 51%, meaning it paid out 51% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nLooking at this fiscal year, BRX expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $2.22 per share, with earnings expected to increase 4.23% from the year ago period.\nBottom Line\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, BRX is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/dell-technologies-inc-dell-attracting-investor-attention-here-what-you-should-know-7","Article":"Dell Technologies (DELL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this computer and technology services provider have returned -14.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Dell Technologies belongs, has lost 8.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nDell Technologies is expected to post earnings of $1.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. This estimate has changed -5.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.09 indicates a change of +12.6% from what Dell Technologies is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Dell Technologies.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Dell Technologies, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.07 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $101.86 billion and $109.8 billion estimates indicate +6.6% and +7.8% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nDell Technologies reported revenues of $23.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.20 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.66 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.95%. The EPS surprise was +5.93%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nDell Technologies is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Dell Technologies. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/brfs-vs-kryay-which-stock-better-value-option-1","Article":"Investors with an interest in Food - Miscellaneous stocks have likely encountered both BRF (BRFS) and Kerry Group PLC (KRYAY). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.\nCurrently, BRF has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Kerry Group PLC has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that BRFS's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\nBRFS currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 10.37, while KRYAY has a forward P\/E of 20.06. We also note that BRFS has a PEG ratio of 0.25. This metric is used similarly to the famous P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. KRYAY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.76.\nAnother notable valuation metric for BRFS is its P\/B ratio of 1.28. Investors use the P\/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, KRYAY has a P\/B of 2.53.\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to BRFS's Value grade of A and KRYAY's Value grade of C.\nBRFS is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that BRFS is likely the superior value option right now.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its primary competitors in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. By closely examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, our aim is to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.\nNVIDIA Background\nNvidia is a leading developer of graphics processing units. Traditionally, GPUs were used to enhance the experience on computing platforms, most notably in gaming applications on PCs. GPU use cases have since emerged as important semiconductors used in artificial intelligence. Nvidia not only offers AI GPUs, but also a software platform, Cuda, used for AI model development and training. Nvidia is also expanding its data center networking solutions, helping to tie GPUs together to handle complex workloads.\nCOMPANY P\/E P\/B P\/S ROE EBITDA (IN BILLIONS) GROSS PROFIT (IN BILLIONS) REVENUE GROWTH\nNVIDIA Corp 35.54 32.14 19.86 30.42% $25.82 $28.72 77.94%\nBroadcom Inc 80.84 11.76 15.44 8.01% $8.54 $10.14 24.71%\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 21.71 5.94 8.80 9.05% $596.09 $512.38 38.84%\nQualcomm Inc 14.64 5.59 3.76 11.97% $4.23 $6.51 17.45%\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc 88.29 2.49 5.61 0.84% $1.69 $3.88 24.16%\nTexas Instruments Inc 28.18 7.89 8.61 7.02% $1.92 $2.31 -1.72%\nARM Holdings PLC 132.89 16.58 29.01 4.05% $0.22 $0.95 19.3%\nAnalog Devices Inc 56.21 2.49 9.40 1.11% $1.03 $1.43 -3.56%\nMicron Technology Inc 16.59 1.59 2.50 3.32% $3.95 $2.96 38.27%\nMonolithic Power Systems Inc 14.34 7.99 11.61 52.73% $0.17 $0.34 36.93%\nMicrochip Technology Inc 66.58 3.38 4.33 -0.87% $0.21 $0.56 -41.89%\nSTMicroelectronics NV 12.12 1.03 1.42 1.95% $0.89 $1.25 -22.42%\nASE Technology Holding Co Ltd 18.46 1.80 0.98 2.95% $30.11 $26.62 1.05%\nUnited Microelectronics Corp 11.86 1.47 2.41 2.28% $29.73 $20.43 -0.16%\nON Semiconductor Corp 9.44 1.64 2.09 4.37% $0.62 $0.78 -14.65%\nFirst Solar Inc 10.35 1.67 3.18 5.05% $0.58 $0.57 30.68%\nSkyworks Solutions Inc 17.19 1.34 2.23 2.54% $0.31 $0.44 -11.07%\nCredo Technology Group Holding Ltd 1257.33 10.36 20.32 4.95% $0.03 $0.09 154.44%\nLattice Semiconductor Corp 94.52 8.05 11.29 2.33% $0.02 $0.07 -31.17%\nUniversal Display Corp 24.45 3.34 8.36 2.87% $0.06 $0.12 2.51%\nQorvo Inc 202.93 1.57 1.44 1.22% $0.14 $0.39 -14.67%\nAverage 108.95 4.9 7.64 6.39% $34.03 $29.61 12.35%\nWhen conducting a detailed analysis of NVIDIA, the following trends become clear:\nThe Price to Earnings ratio of 35.54 is 0.33x lower than the industry average, indicating potential undervaluation for the stock.\nIt could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 32.14 which exceeds the industry average by 6.56x.\nThe Price to Sales ratio of 19.86, which is 2.6x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.\nWith a Return on Equity (ROE) of 30.42% that is 24.03% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits.\nThe Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $25.82 Billion is 0.76x below the industry average, suggesting potential lower profitability or financial challenges.\nThe company has lower gross profit of $28.72 Billion, which indicates 0.97x below the industry average. This potentially indicates lower revenue after accounting for production costs.\nThe company's revenue growth of 77.94% is notably higher compared to the industry average of 12.35%, showcasing exceptional sales performance and strong demand for its products or services.\nDebt To Equity Ratio\nThe debt-to-equity (D\/E) ratio gauges the extent to which a company has financed its operations through debt relative to equity.\nConsidering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.\nWhen assessing NVIDIA against its top 4 peers using the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following comparisons can be made:\nNVIDIA has a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers, as evidenced by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.13.\nThis suggests that the company has a more favorable balance between debt and equity, which can be perceived as a positive indicator by investors.\nKey Takeaways\nThe PE, PB, and PS ratios for NVIDIA are indicating that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. On the other hand, the high ROE, low EBITDA, low gross profit, and high revenue growth suggest that NVIDIA is performing well and has strong growth potential within the industry sector.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.\nLatest Ratings for NVDA\nDATE FIRM ACTION FROM TO\nApr 2025 UBS Maintains Buy Buy\nApr 2025 Rosenblatt Maintains Buy Buy\nApr 2025 DA Davidson Maintains Neutral Neutral\nView More Analyst Ratings for NVDA\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/flagstar-financial-flg-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy","Article":"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Flagstar Financial (FLG) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis bank holding company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +65.3%.\nRevenues are expected to be $522.36 million, down 17.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.88% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Flagstar Financial?\nFor Flagstar Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +9.96%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Flagstar Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Flagstar Financial would post a loss of $0.50 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.34, delivering a surprise of +32%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nFlagstar Financial appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAtlantic Union (AUB), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Northeast industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.69 for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +6.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $220.7 million, up 24.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Atlantic Union has been revised 1.8% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Atlantic Union will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in Flagstar Financial, Inc.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 12.56% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nAt this time, Five Below has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

EPS of $8.46 for the same period compares with $8.08 a year ago.\nFor the current quarter, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $5.73 per share, indicating a change of -11.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8% over the last 30 days.\nUlta has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of B.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

In the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2025, Nvidia's data center revenue grew 93% year over year to $35.6 billion (over 90% of total revenue).\nNvidia investors shouldn't expect data revenue to keep growing at 90%+ quarter after quarter, but any huge drops in growth could be a red flag that demand for AI infrastructure is falling or Nvidia is losing market share to competitors like Advanced Micro Devices. However, given Nvidia's market dominance, it would likely be the former.\nMuch of Nvidia's valuation is built on high investor expectations of AI-driven growth and continued dominance in the data center market. Any signs of noticeable demand decline could cause investors to jump ship and the stock to become extra volatile (or more volatile than it already has been).\nPaying attention to Nvidia's data center revenue can help investors gauge whether the AI boom is progressing, becoming stagnant, or fading. In either case, that could affect Nvidia's value proposition to investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/depth-analysis-microsoft-versus-competitors-software-industry-5","Article":"In today's rapidly changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, it is vital for investors and industry enthusiasts to carefully evaluate companies. In this article, we will perform a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) against its key competitors in the Software industry. By analyzing important financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.\nMicrosoft Background\nMicrosoft develops and licenses consumer and enterprise software. It is known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. The company is organized into three equally sized broad segments: productivity and business processes (legacy Microsoft Office, cloud-based Office 365, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype, LinkedIn, Dynamics), intelligence cloud (infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service offerings Azure, Windows Server OS, SQL Server), and more personal computing (Windows Client, Xbox, Bing search, display advertising, and Surface laptops, tablets, and desktops).\nCOMPANY P\/E P\/B P\/S ROE EBITDA (IN BILLIONS) GROSS PROFIT (IN BILLIONS) REVENUE GROWTH\nMicrosoft Corp 29.94 9.13 10.60 8.17% $36.79 $47.83 12.27%\nOracle Corp 30.46 21.75 6.65 19.27% $5.89 $9.94 6.4%\nServiceNow Inc 116.47 17.16 15.12 4.06% $0.62 $2.33 21.34%\nPalo Alto Networks Inc 95.91 17.63 14.04 4.35% $0.41 $1.66 14.29%\nFortinet Inc 42.51 49.45 12.45 43.82% $0.66 $1.35 17.31%\nGen Digital Inc 23.82 6.96 3.91 7.48% $0.45 $0.79 4.01%\nMonday.Com Ltd 403.77 12.34 13.50 2.3% $0.07 $0.24 32.29%\nDolby Laboratories Inc 26.71 2.77 5.33 2.72% $0.11 $0.32 13.13%\nCommVault Systems Inc 39.75 23.09 7.24 3.9% $0.02 $0.21 21.13%\nQualys Inc 26.10 9.28 7.46 9.49% $0.05 $0.13 10.11%\nProgress Software Corp 44.15 5.59 3.09 2.51% $0.07 $0.19 28.88%\nTeradata Corp 17.47 14.64 1.14 19.38% $0.06 $0.24 -10.5%\nRapid7 Inc 57.08 82.46 1.71 -25.97% $0.02 $0.15 5.36%\nAverage 77.02 21.93 7.64 7.78% $0.7 $1.46 13.65%\nBy conducting an in-depth analysis of Microsoft, we can identify the following trends:\nAt 29.94, the stock's Price to Earnings ratio is 0.39x less than the industry average, suggesting favorable growth potential.\nConsidering a Price to Book ratio of 9.13, which is well below the industry average by 0.42x, the stock may be undervalued based on its book value compared to its peers.\nWith a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 10.6, which is 1.39x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance.\nWith a Return on Equity (ROE) of 8.17% that is 0.39% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits.\nCompared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $36.79 Billion, which is 52.56x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.\nCompared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $47.83 Billion, which indicates 32.76x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.\nThe company's revenue growth of 12.27% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 13.65%. This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance.\nDebt To Equity Ratio\nThe debt-to-equity (D\/E) ratio is a financial metric that helps determine the level of financial risk associated with a company's capital structure.\nConsidering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.\nWhen examining Microsoft in comparison to its top 4 peers with respect to the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following information becomes apparent:\nWhen considering the debt-to-equity ratio, Microsoft exhibits a stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers.\nThis indicates that the company has a favorable balance between debt and equity, with a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.21, which can be perceived as a positive aspect by investors.\nKey Takeaways\nFor Microsoft in the Software industry, the PE and PB ratios suggest the company is undervalued compared to its peers, indicating potential for growth. However, the high PS ratio implies that the stock may be overvalued based on its revenue. In terms of profitability, Microsoft's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit margins outperform industry standards, showcasing strong financial performance. The low revenue growth rate may indicate a need for strategic initiatives to drive top-line expansion.\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.\nLatest Ratings for MSFT\nDATE FIRM ACTION FROM TO\nApr 2025 Keybanc Downgrades Overweight Sector Weight\nApr 2025 BMO Capital Maintains Outperform Outperform\nApr 2025 B of A Securities Maintains Buy Buy\nView More Analyst Ratings for MSFT\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/enova-international-enva-stock-undervalued-right-now-0","Article":"While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.\nOf these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nIn addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with \"A\" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.\nOne stock to keep an eye on is Enova International (ENVA). ENVA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P\/E ratio of 7.48. This compares to its industry's average Forward P\/E of 8.02. Over the last 12 months, ENVA's Forward P\/E has been as high as 10.85 and as low as 6.47, with a median of 8.44.\nValue investors also love the P\/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. ENVA has a P\/S ratio of 0.89. This compares to its industry's average P\/S of 1.26.\nThese are just a handful of the figures considered in Enova International's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that ENVA is an impressive value stock right now.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/emcor-group-inc-eme-trending-stock-facts-know-betting-it-2","Article":"Emcor Group (EME) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this construction and maintenance company have returned -5.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry, to which Emcor Group belongs, has lost 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Emcor Group is expected to post earnings of $4.57 per share, indicating a change of +9.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.37 points to a change of +8.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.40 indicates a change of +8.7% from what Emcor Group is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Emcor Group.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Emcor Group, the consensus sales estimate of $3.8 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.6%. The $16.43 billion and $17.19 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.8% and +4.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nEmcor Group reported revenues of $3.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.6%. EPS of $6.32 for the same period compares with $4.47 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.64%. The EPS surprise was +14.08%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nEmcor Group is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Emcor Group. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/ee-vs-tln-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now","Article":"Investors looking for stocks in the Alternative Energy - Other sector might want to consider either Excelerate Energy (EE) or Talen Energy Corporation (TLN). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\nThere are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nExcelerate Energy has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Talen Energy Corporation has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\nValue investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nThe Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.\nEE currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 18.22, while TLN has a forward P\/E of 25.41. We also note that EE has a PEG ratio of 0.94. This metric is used similarly to the famous P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TLN currently has a PEG ratio of 3.41.\nAnother notable valuation metric for EE is its P\/B ratio of 1.49. Investors use the P\/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TLN has a P\/B of 7.46.\nThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to EE's Value grade of B and TLN's Value grade of C.\nEE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TLN, so it seems like value investors will conclude that EE is the superior option right now.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/ebay-crosses-above-average-analyst-target-1","Article":"In recent trading, shares of eBay Inc. (Symbol: EBAY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $66.03, changing hands for $66.26\/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\nThere are 28 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for eBay Inc., but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $49.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $80.00. The standard deviation is $7.436.\nBut the whole reason to look at the average EBAY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with EBAY crossing above that average target price of $66.03\/share, investors in EBAY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $66.03 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover eBay Inc.:\nRECENT EBAY ANALYST RATINGS BREAKDOWN\n» Current 1 Month Ago 2 Month Ago 3 Month Ago\nStrong buy ratings: 9 9 9 9\nBuy ratings: 1 1 1 1\nHold ratings: 17 17 17 17\nSell ratings: 1 1 1 1\nStrong sell ratings: 2 2 2 1\nAverage rating: 2.53 2.53 2.53 2.45\nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/earnings-preview-lyondellbasell-lyb-q1-earnings-expected-decline","Article":"The market expects LyondellBasell (LYB) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis oil refiner and chemical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.36 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -76.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $7.59 billion, down 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 25.03% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LyondellBasell?\nFor LyondellBasell, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -11.69%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LyondellBasell will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that LyondellBasell would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering no surprise.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lazard?\nFor Lazard, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Lazard will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lazard would post earnings of $0.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering a surprise of +52.94%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/nvidia-corporation-nvda-trending-stock-facts-know-betting-it-6","Article":"Nvidia (NVDA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -14.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has lost 15.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.90 per share, indicating a change of +47.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.32 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +44.5%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.38 indicates a change of +24.6% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $42.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +64.3%. The $195.34 billion and $239.55 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +49.7% and +22.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nNvidia reported revenues of $39.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +77.9%. EPS of $0.89 for the same period compares with $0.52 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.26%. The EPS surprise was +5.95%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nNvidia is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren’t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To help you understand an important aspect of this sizeable sale, GOBankingRates reached out to industry experts who provided insights on the worst (and the best) days to list a house.\nThe Worst Day to List Your House…\nAccording to Zillow research, houses listed on a Sunday sat on the market longer than those listed on “better” days. Experts don’t like Mondays either.\n“In my opinion, Mondays are the absolute worst day to list a house,” said Jeremy Smith, ace real estate advisor with Engel & Volkers in Atlanta. “Why? Because everyone’s just trying to survive Monday! People are catching up from the weekend, drowning in emails and settling back into their routines — house hunting is the last thing on their minds. If you list on a Monday, your property risks getting buried in the shuffle before buyers are even paying attention, which can quietly rack up days on the market.”\nFor You: 25 Places To Buy a Home If You Want It To Gain Value\n“And Sunday?” Smith asked. “Meh. People are winding down with family, brunch or Netflix. They may browse Zillow in bed that night, but they’re not scheduling tours.”\nSurprisingly, Saturday gets little love as well, according to Todd Stephenson, co-founder of RoofQuotes.com, a company that connects homeowners with local roofing companies.\n“The WORST DAY to list a home is actually Saturday, contrary to popular belief about Sundays or Mondays,” said Stephenson. “Our analysis of listing patterns with partner agents reveals Saturday listings receive 23% fewer serious inquiries in their critical first 48 hours compared to midweek listings.\n“The issue isn’t buyer activity, since people absolutely browse homes on weekends,” he added. “The real problem is visibility decay. When you list on Saturday, your property gets buried under the flood of new Monday listings before most buyers have finished their weekend browsing. By Tuesday, your ‘new’ listing already looks stale in search filters.”\n…and the Best Day to List Your House\nAdvertising your house on a Thursday may enhance the likelihood that it will sell faster and for a higher price, per Zillow. All other things being equal, homes advertised on Thursdays tended to go pending more quickly than any other day of the week.\nSmith, for one, agrees.\n“Now, if you really want your home to shine, Thursday is the magic day,” he said. “That’s when buyers start getting serious about weekend plans, lining up showings, and stalking new listings. Friday works too, but Thursday gives you that early jump.”\nSavvy Buyers Realty’s Robert Washington and his team recognize the huge benefits of listing on a Thursday, too.\n“Thursday afternoon tends to be the best time to list a home,” said the company’s founder and broker. “The tendency is that home buyers and their agents will start to plan out their showing schedule for the weekend on Friday.\n“Many of the MLS client listing distributions don’t send out notifications until the evening, and if you wait until Friday to list, your home may not show up until that evening and you potentially miss out getting the listing in front of buyers that are looking earlier in the day.”\nEvery market is different, however, and you’ll get different answers from experts in different states and countries. For example, My Reiderstad’s Invest team operates mainly in the Southwest of Mallorca, Spain, and hypes Tuesday and Friday listings.\n“Tuesday, because on Monday people usually have a long to-do list, new weeks start so they do not have the mindset to look for new houses, and Friday because it is the end of the week, people are in weekend mood, stop working earlier and have time to browse through property portals and possibly discuss them over the weekend with friends and family,” said Mallorca’s premier end-to-end realtor.\nNot to be left out, while no expert chose Wednesday as the best day to list a home, Redfin did a few years ago. Using weak Sunday numbers as a baseline comparison, the residential real estate brokerage site found that Wednesday listings sold for the most money. Thursday listings still sold the fastest.   \nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Used Luxury SUVs That Are a Good Investment for Retirees\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n7 Overpriced Grocery Items Frugal People Should Quit Buying in 2025\n4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Don’t List Your House for Sale on This Day of the Week — Here’s Why\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/brinker-international-inc-eat-attracting-investor-attention-here-what-you-should-know-6","Article":"Brinker International (EAT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this operator of restaurant chains Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy have returned +5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, which Brinker International falls in, has lost 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Brinker International is expected to post earnings of $2.48 per share, indicating a change of +100% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.33 points to a change of +103.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.29 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Brinker International is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Brinker International.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Brinker International, the consensus sales estimate of $1.36 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.7%. The $5.24 billion and $5.43 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.6% and +3.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nBrinker International reported revenues of $1.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.5%. EPS of $2.80 for the same period compares with $0.99 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.32%. The EPS surprise was +55.56%.\nOver the last four quarters, Brinker International surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBrinker International is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Brinker International. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren’t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This includes executives in the c-suite and major hedge funds. These insiders are mandated to disclose their transactions through a Form 4 filing, to be submitted within two business days of the transaction.\nPointing towards optimism, a company insider's new purchase signals their positive anticipation for the stock to rise.\nNevertheless, insider sells may not necessarily indicate a bearish view and can be influenced by various factors.\nA Deep Dive into Insider Transaction Codes\nNavigating through the landscape of transactions, investors often prioritize those unfolding in the open market, precisely detailed in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 denotes a purchase, while S signifies a sale.

But there are also some surprising costs that come with owning a vacation home that could cost you extra money.\nFind Out: Real Estate Agents: 4 Best US Mountain Towns To Buy Property in the Next 5 Years\nRead Next: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\nRead on for the value and surprising costs of a vacation home and whether or not it’s worth it.\nThe Value and Hidden Costs of Vacation Rentals\nVrbo’s revenue grew to more than $3.8 billion in 2024, more than double its 2017 numbers, according to data published by the Business of Apps. As vacation rental supply growth slows in 2025, according to AirDNA, hosts have more opportunities to attract their ideal clients and command more money for in-demand properties.\nBut before you invest, it’s wise to consider the costs involved. Running a vacation rental, or even maintaining a vacation home, isn’t the same as the costs involved with your primary residence.\n“For anyone considering a vacation home, it’s easy to underestimate the true carrying costs,” said Kevin Reed, chief revenue officer at Aquilance, a personal financial management firm for UHNW families and family offices. When he provides his ultra-high-net-worth clients a “really detailed breakout per [vacation] home” to see how much they spend, they are almost always surprised at the cost.\n“You start to look at how often you’re using the home compared to the total cost to maintain the home,” he said. And while you can offset some of these costs by renting the property when you’re not using it, it may not be worth the costs.\nHere are five expenses to be aware of before you put a down payment on that dream getaway.\nExplore More: 10 Best Places To Buy a Short-Term Rental Property To Earn Passive Income in 2025\nInsurance Specific to That Property\nAs homeowners struggle with rising insurance costs across the board, insurance on vacation homes often exceeds budget expectations — especially on waterfront properties in high-risk regions.\n“The high risk of damage from storms, flooding or even just the effects of saltwater can lead to higher premiums,” Reed said. “Vacancy or using it as a short-term rental are other factors that can drive a higher risk rating from insurers.”\nTo save on insurance, choose your second home carefully — ideally, away from places with a high risk of fires, floods or tornadoes.\nTaxes\nJust as you should evaluate home insurance rates before choosing your vacation property, consider the property taxes in the area. “Some homes are in high-cost-of-living areas,” Reed said, “but many are in rural settings.”\nIf your goal is to get away from it all, you may find lower property taxes in a region known more for babbling brooks than A-list parties.\nHome Repair and Improvement Costs\nIn spite of lower overall costs for the home and property taxes, rural areas have financial drawbacks too.\n“We bought a vacation home in the middle of a national forest and turned it into a short-term vacation rental. Due to the rural location and lack of providers, the cost for a plumber to unclog a toilet at this property is twice as high as we would pay at our home in the suburbs of Chicago,” Reed said, speaking from experience.\nMaintaining a vacation home anywhere requires forging connections with a set of service providers outside of your home region, Reed explained.\nLawn and Garden Maintenance\nLikewise, a vacation home needs year-round landscaping, whether that means lawn maintenance or leaf and snow removal.\nVacation homes often require “specialized landscaping for larger or more unique properties,” Reed said. These costs add up.\nUtilities\nFinally, Reed noted that the “cumulative effect of smaller, recurring expenses that don’t feel significant individually but add up over time” often surprises clients who own second homes.\nThese costs can include electricity, heat and internet connectivity, which can cost more in rural areas.\nIs a Vacation Home the Right Choice for You?\nA study from Talker Research, commissioned by IHG Hotels & Resorts, revealed that 59% of retirees plan to travel more during retirement. Gen Z isn’t far behind boomers in their travel aspirations. Gen Z spent an average of $11,000 on travel in 2024, according to Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection’s 2025 State of Travel Insurance Report. This earned the cohort the designation of travel’s “fastest-growing consumer segment” according to Travel Age West.  \nA vacation home can help make travel more affordable — especially if you use vacation rental revenue to fund other trips or negotiate home swaps with other travelers. But depending on your travel plans and your wealth-building goals, a vacation home may not be the best investment.\n“The rate of appreciation might be lower than other potential investments, especially when factoring in the carrying costs, effectively reducing the net return. The illiquidity of real estate is another factor; it’s not as easily converted to cash as public market investments,” Reed said.\nIf your vacation home ties up a significant portion of your wealth, at the expense of investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bonds, gold or other assets, it may not be the best choice either. A diversified portfolio is best at any stage of life.\n“Weigh the purely financial aspects against the emotional value the home provides,” Reed said. “It’s a very personal decision, but having a clear financial understanding empowers [you] to make an informed choice.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Luxury Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Spring 2025\n4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Surprising Costs of a Vacation Home  — Is It Worth It?\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

(Nasdaq: POWW, POWWP) (“AMMO,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), the owner of GunBroker.com, the largest online marketplace for firearms, hunting, and related products, today announced it has completed the sale of its ammunition manufacturing assets to Olin Winchester, LLC (“Olin Winchester”), a subsidiary of Olin Corporation.\n\n\nThis transaction represents a pivotal milestone in AMMO’s transformation into a high-margin, tech-enabled e-commerce company centered around GunBroker.com. The Company intends to focus resources on scaling its digital platform, improving user experience, and unlocking additional value for shareholders.\n\n\n“This transaction marks a defining moment in AMMO’s evolution,” said Christos Tsentas, Chair of the Board’s M&A Committee. “After a thorough strategic review and collaboration with our financial and legal advisors, we are confident this sale will unlock significant value and enable AMMO to accelerate growth as a pure-play e-commerce platform. GunBroker.com is already the leader in the online firearms marketplace, and we expect this streamlined focus will allow us to double down on innovation, user engagement, and long-term profitability.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGunBroker.com: Positioned for Scalable Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nGunBroker.com becomes AMMO’s remaining core business and a high-potential growth engine. Recent initiatives—including enhancements to the checkout experience and expanded offerings in outdoor gear and experiences—have led to improved customer engagement and conversion. The Company anticipates that a simplified business structure and a fortified balance sheet will further fuel targeted investments, operational efficiency, and disciplined capital allocation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction Details\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the transaction, Olin Winchester acquired AMMO’s 185,000-square-foot manufacturing and ballistic testing facility in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.\n\n\nEntering into the transaction, which was unanimously approved by AMMO’s Board and its M&A Committee, was the culmination of a comprehensive strategic review process beginning in February 2024, during which the Company worked with a team of independent advisors to engage with an array of prospective buyers. That comprehensive strategic review process included: establishing an M&A Committee comprised solely of independent directors; evaluating multiple investment banks to assist the Board and the M&A Committee, which ultimately led to the engagement of Baird; pursuing a thorough and competitive sale process that involved 15 potential buyers; selecting Lake Street Capital Markets (“Lake Street”), from among a group of firms evaluated by the M&A Committee, to conduct an independent analysis of the transaction in connection with the rendering of a fairness opinion to the Board, which opinion was sought from Lake Street regardless of whether its ultimate conclusions were favorable or unfavorable; Lake Street’s determination that the transaction was fair from a financial point of view, and that it fell within a range of possible values; and engaging in a thorough and deliberate evaluation process by the M&A Committee and the entire Board, which considered the merits and risks of the multiple bids and the proposed transaction with Olin Winchester, as well as strategic alternatives to the proposed transaction with Olin Winchester.\n\n\nAs previously disclosed, we believe the Company has significant opportunities to grow and scale\n\nGunBroker.com\n\n, as the e-commerce space for the firearms and shooting sports industries continues expanding. Among other reasons, as a result of higher supply costs relative to our larger manufacturing competitors, challenges in securing larger government contracts due to our manufacturing capacity, industry headwinds, and historical operating losses in the ammunition segment diverting our resources from growth opportunities, we believe the sale of the ammunition manufacturing assets will enable us to capitalize on e-commerce growth opportunities, while allowing the Company to become a more focused, streamlined and profitable organization. Moving forward, the Company expects to focus on growing and prioritizing the profitable, high-margin\n\nGunBroker.com\n\nmarketplace. The successful completion of this transaction is expected to further simplify the business, while reinforcing AMMO’s cash position to support expansion and thoughtful capital allocation. The Company expects to use the proceeds from the transaction for general corporate purposes, although the Board may evaluate other uses in the future when and as appropriate.\n\n\nAMMO was advised by Baird and represented by Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP in connection with the transaction. Lake Street Capital Markets provided a fairness opinion to the Board.\n\n\n\n\n\nRebranding and Next Phase\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with the sale, AMMO is beginning a formal rebranding process, including a corporate name change to\n\nOutdoor Holding Company\n\n, to better reflect its e-commerce identity and broader vision in the outdoor lifestyle and sporting goods sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Company Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNasdaq Listing Compliance\n\n\n\nAs disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 25, 2025, the Company received an additional deficiency notification letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), requiring the Company to submit an updated plan by no later than March 6, 2025 concerning its efforts to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “target,” “believe,” “expect,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “would,” “positioned,” “future,” and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about the expected benefits of the transaction and statements about the Company’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions for its business following consummation of the transaction.

It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts.

It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $731.52 million, exhibiting an increase of 6.8% compared to the year-ago quarter.\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 0.5% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\nBearing this in mind, let's now explore the average estimates of specific Carpenter metrics that are commonly monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Net Sales- End-Use Market Excluding Surcharge Revenue- Total' will likely reach $594.40 million.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/after-plunging-1895-4-weeks-heres-why-trend-might-reverse-agnc-investment-agnc","Article":"AGNC Investment (AGNC) has been beaten down lately with too much selling pressure. While the stock has lost 19% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.\nGuide to Identifying Oversold Stocks\nWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\nRSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.\nTechnically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.\nSo, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.\nHowever, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.\nWhy a Trend Reversal is Due for AGNC\nThe RSI reading of 29.99 for AGNC is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.\nThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering AGNC in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 2.8% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\nMoreover, AGNC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/aem-crosses-above-average-analyst-target-0","Article":"In recent trading, shares of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (Symbol: AEM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $121.61, changing hands for $122.67\/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.\nThere are 13 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $106.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $142.00. The standard deviation is $12.165.\nBut the whole reason to look at the average AEM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AEM crossing above that average target price of $121.61\/share, investors in AEM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $121.61 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd:\nRECENT AEM ANALYST RATINGS BREAKDOWN\n» Current 1 Month Ago 2 Month Ago 3 Month Ago\nStrong buy ratings: 10 10 10 10\nBuy ratings: 3 3 3 3\nHold ratings: 2 1 1 1\nSell ratings: 0 0 0 0\nStrong sell ratings: 0 0 0 0\nAverage rating: 1.47 1.36 1.36 1.36\nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/abbvie-abbv-earnings-expected-grow-what-know-ahead-next-weeks-release","Article":"AbbVie (ABBV) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.9%.\nRevenues are expected to be $12.88 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AbbVie?\nFor AbbVie, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.61%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AbbVie will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that AbbVie would post earnings of $2.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.16, delivering a surprise of +1.41%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAbbVie doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\nMerck (MRK), another stock in the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.16 for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +4.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $15.48 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Merck has been revised 4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.04%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Merck will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in AbbVie Inc.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/5-side-hustles-will-let-me-buy-my-dog-everything-she-wants","Article":"Like all dog parents, I have to admit that my fur baby deserves nothing less than the very best of everything. Ever since Mina the Lab mix came to rule my household with puppy eyes and an iron paw, she’s agreed with me on that — even if we disagree on the number of snacks she should have each day. I lean toward a healthy middle ground. She prefers infinity.\nLearn More: 5 Financial Steps Most People Never Consider — and It’s Costing Them\nFor You: 7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThere’s simply no better way for me to express the joy she’s brought to me and my family other than buying her everything she wants, when she wants it. And she’s a simple girl, really. She doesn’t care about Cartier collars or water bowls filled with Cristal champagne. She just wants to travel to fun locations for her W-A-L-K-S, enjoy loads of cookies, and maybe dive into a swimming pool full of bones she could swim in like Scrooge McDuck. Oh, and she wouldn’t mind an in-home dispenser of pup cups. \nIf you’re also looking to spoil your furry bestie without breaking the bank, these five side hustles might just fetch you the extra cash.\n1. Tutoring\nOkay, this is doable on my off-hours. I could go to a formal learning center and help kids with writing and reading from a pre-planned curriculum. Even better, I could set my own schedule and my own rates — maybe starting at $35 an hour. It might take a lot of hours to fund a ballroom filled with Kongs and peanut butter, but who needs sleep anyway?\nIf you’ve ever been the go-to person for helping others study, tutoring might be your ticket to turning that into extra cash. You can start by advertising your services online or through flyers at your local community center or library. Entry-level tutors typically charge around $25 an hour, but if you specialize in high-demand subjects like SAT or ACT prep, you could command rates anywhere from $50 to $150. \n2. Barista \nLook, I did it in college. I could do it again, even if the drink names sound like baby names befitting an Oompa Loompa. A few early shifts before I clock in for my real job, and maybe a shift after. Yes, the pay is just $15 an hour, but I’d have access to free pup cup materials — whipped cream, anyone? — and that should end up saving me some cash in the long run.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for baristas is $13.80, though it can climb higher with tips or at certain chains.\n3. Professional Cuddler \nOkay, if there’s one thing that being a dog mom to a very fluffy, very affectionate gal has prepared me for, it’s this gig. Those lazy mornings on the couch snuggling were actually my Rocky-style training montage for a job where I could make upwards of $100 for platonically — emphasis on platonically — hugging and cuddling lonely people in my city. Although actually, Mina might be a better fit for this job. \nYes, this is a real job. And yes, I was as surprised as you are to discover that. But it does pay well. One professional cuddler interviewed by Business Insider said she made $100 an hour, depending on the session and client demand. As for getting started, there are plenty of platforms like Cuddle Comfort and resources such as Cuddle Career that offer advice about how to safely start this side business. \n4. Party Crasher for Hire \nIf Lab parents are adept at one thing, it’s embracing chaos. In my first week with Mina, she showed me that crate life was, ahem, not for her, and just last week, she knocked over an air fryer to get at her food bag. So being a party crasher for hire should be as easy as licking the peanut butter center out of a bone. \nI could build a whole side business offering to pose as someone’s jilted ex at a wedding, or a zealous corporate headhunter breaking into a trade conference to “poach” my client — all to make them look more appealing while padding my bank account. \nBelieve it or not, people do post gigs like this on Reddit and other social media. Some charge $200 or more per event, depending on the role, the prep involved, and the chaos quotient. Plus, if there’s food? That’s a win-win. Or a woof-woof. \n5. Professional Clowning \nI nearly added dog walking here. It felt like the perfect “Mommy and Me” job, until I remembered Mina’s jealous side eye. The second I pet another good boy or good girl, it would be game over. So, what else am I good at? Well, having a dog means making a lot of funny faces and goofy voices. Hey, I could be a clown, right?\nRead Next: 6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nNot a Cirque du Soleil clown. I like my bones where they are. But a party clown, maybe. The nice thing is, one doesn’t need to run away with the circus to get started — there are actual training programs like Clowns Without Borders (CWB), clown colleges (yes, they’re real!), or community theater workshops that can teach you the basics. According to Backstage, once you’ve built your act, you can strike out on your own and work parties or other events, charging between $100 and $500, depending on your props, costumes and experience.\nBottom Line: You know, maybe it would just be easier to take her to grandma’s house.  \nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nI'm a Realtor: This Is Why No One Wants To See Your Home\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and You Can, Too\nElon Musk's Net Worth: How It Compares to Your Lifetime Earnings\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Side Hustles That Will Let Me Buy My Dog Everything She Wants\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}
{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/5-reasons-you-should-and-should-not-buy-apple-dividends-according-experts","Article":"Apple is a household name and one of the most valuable companies in the world. Known for its innovative products and exceptional brand loyalty, it has become a staple in many investors’ portfolios.\nHowever, when it comes to buying Apple for the dividends, opinions among experts vary.\nTrending Now: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Bought Over $73 Million in Shares of This Tech Company — Here’s Why\nRead Next: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nHere are five reasons why you should — or shouldn’t — consider Apple’s dividend stock strategy for your personal portfolio.\nReasons You Should Buy Apple for the Dividends\nSteady dividend growth: Apple has consistently increased its dividend payouts over the years, providing reliable income to shareholders. Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, told CNBC: “You’re getting a 9% dividend growth over the last five years and earnings growth is expected to accelerate. So, I think this is when you can even buy here and certainly with the recent pullback, and then you plan to hold it for quite some time.”\nStrong cash flow and profits: With a massive cash reserve, Apple is in a position to continue paying dividends. Its cash flow and profit-generating capabilities make it less likely that the company will struggle to maintain its dividend payments, even during economic downturns. According to Forbes, despite low dividend yields, “The company’s conservative payout ratio of 15% provides substantial room for future dividend increases, potentially doubling the payout over the next five years while maintaining financial flexibility for investments and acquisitions.”\nAppealing for long-term investors: Apple’s dividend payouts are not the highest in the market, but they offer a steady source of income that can appreciate over time. For long-term investors, this stability combined with Apple’s capital appreciation potential offers a balanced risk\/reward profile. According to Nasdaq, “Investors can reasonably expect annual increases for the foreseeable future, considering management has raised it for 13 consecutive years.”\nDividend reinvestment potential: If you’re looking to reinvest your dividends, Apple’s steady growth and solid dividend policy can compound over time, potentially offering solid returns through reinvestment.\nTrusted brand and market position: Apple’s dominance in the tech industry provides a sense of stability that dividend investors seek. As an established leader with consistent earnings, Apple offers reassurance to dividend-seeking investors who want to avoid risky, volatile stocks.\nConsider This: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire — 5 Stocks You Shouldn’t Sell\nReasons You Should Not Buy Apple for the Dividends\nLower dividend yield: Compared to other dividend stocks, Apple’s dividend yield is relatively low. Experts caution that if you’re looking for high-yield dividend stocks, Apple may not be the right choice. Many companies in the utility or REIT sectors, for example, offer much higher dividend yields. According to Forbes, “The current dividend of [96 cents] annually represents just a 0.5% yield, significantly below the S&P 500 average of 1.5%.”\nSlow growth in dividend payments: Although Apple has steadily increased its dividend over time, the increases have been modest compared to other companies in the dividend space. Apple’s dividend increases may not outpace inflation, which could erode purchasing power for income-focused investors.\nHeavy reliance on stock buybacks: Apple has a large buyback program, which means the company uses a significant amount of its profits to repurchase its own shares rather than reinvesting fully in dividends. While this helps boost the stock price, some investors looking for income might feel the company prioritizes stock value appreciation over dividend growth. According to Poole Thought Leadership, “By choosing big annual buybacks over larger dividends, Apple keeps things flexible: It’s like having an option open rather than committing to ongoing payments that don’t respond to how well the business does each year.”\nVulnerability to economic fluctuations: Although Apple has a strong financial position, it’s still susceptible to market and economic fluctuations. A downturn in consumer spending, for example, could affect its earnings and ultimately its ability to sustain dividends.\nDividend is not the primary attraction for investors: According to MarketBeat, Apple is often viewed more as a growth stock than a dividend stock. Most investors are drawn to Apple for its potential to increase in value rather than for consistent dividend payouts. If you’re seeking high yield or consistent passive income, you may wish to explore other dividend-heavy stocks.\nWhether or not Apple is the right choice for dividend-seeking investors largely depends on your financial goals. If you’re looking for steady income with moderate dividend growth, Apple may fit your strategy. However, if you’re in search of higher-yielding dividends, you might want to explore other options. Understanding the balance between growth and income is key to choosing the right stocks for your portfolio.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Luxury Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Spring 2025\n4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Reasons You Should and Should Not Buy Apple for the Dividends, According to Experts\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}
{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/5-money-rules-rich-live-you-should-copy","Article":"Ever wonder how the rich always seem to have their money game on point? It’s not magic — it’s just smart habits. The good news? These money rules are easy to pick up and you don’t have to be a millionaire to use them. \nBelow are some simple strategies the wealthy follow, so you can start making your money work harder for you, too.\nExplore Next: I’m a Financial Advisor: My Wealthiest Clients All Do These 3 Things\nTry This: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nStay Hyper-Aware of Financial Context\nThe rich don’t coast on cruise control. They monitor the entire financial atmosphere around them constantly. They follow interest rate shifts, tax code updates,global marketjitters and even breakthroughs in tech like AI. \n“It’s not paranoia. It’s situational awareness,” said Angelo Crocco, certified public accountant (CPA), chartered global management accountant (CGMA) and owner of AC Accounting.\nRead Next: I’m a Financial Advisor: 10 Most Awesome Things You Can Do for Your Finances\nThey’re decoding what each change means for their money before it hits the headlines. He explained that this isn’t about watching the stock ticker all day. It’s about mentally training yourself to notice how the world moves and how that affects your money ecosystem. \n“A small policy shift in Washington? They’re already gaming out its impact on real estate valuations, bond yields or commodity cycles,” he said.\nAccording to Crocco, most people file taxes and hope for the best. The wealthy, on the other hand, read between the lines every week. They know when to be on offense and when to play defense. “That edge isn’t luck; it’s an obsession,” he added.\nMeasure Every Decision Against Long-Term Compounding Potential\nWhat sets the wealthy apart is that they run silent opportunity-cost math like a reflex. \nBuying a new luxury car? They’re not just thinking about the cost. They calculate what that money won’t earn over 10 or 15 years if invested differently. \n“They view dollars as seeds, not chips to burn,” Crocco said.\nThat internalized trade-off thinking is constant. He noted that most people don’t even factor in time when spending. The wealthy make every financial decision live inside a timeline — and that subtle shift makes all the difference.\nTreat Investing Like a Discipline, Not a Reaction\nWealthy clients don’t chase the market or jump at headlines, said Chris Heerlein, CEO of REAP Financial.\nRather, they follow a long-term strategy and trust compounding over time. After all, Harvard Financial Credit Union research shows that even small, regular contributions can lead to substantial gains thanks to the snowball effect of compound interest.\nOne of his clients stayed fully invested through 2020 without shifting a dollar, even while others were pulling back. \nHe simply rebalanced his portfolio mid-year and let the recovery do the rest, finishing ahead without stress or disruption.\nAutomate Money To Remove Emotion and Error\nHigh-net-worth families often build systems where savings, tax payments and investment contributions run on autopilot. According to Heerlein, that consistency matters more than perfect timing. \nA retired couple he’s worked with uses automated monthly transfers to fund their charitable giving and retirement accounts. “They don’t wait to feel ready each month, it happens automatically, which keeps them on track without the mental load,” he said.\nProtect Before Growing\nBefore putting money into the market, the wealthy focus on stability. That means having proper insurance, an estate plan and access to cash when needed. \nOne of Heerlein’s clients paused new investments to shore up his liability coverage after acquiring a rental property. \n“It wasn’t glamorous, but it gave him the confidence to scale without fear of an unexpected lawsuit or emergency draining his assets,” Heerlein said.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Used Luxury SUVs That Are a Good Investment for Retirees\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n7 Overpriced Grocery Items Frugal People Should Quit Buying in 2025\n4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Money Rules the Rich Live by That You Should Copy\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}
{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/5-money-mistakes-boomers-must-avoid-recession","Article":"No one likes the word “recession.” It brings to mind tight budgets, stressful news headlines and that nagging feeling you should probably cancel all your streaming subscriptions — even if you don’t want to.\nLearn More: Trump Isn’t Ruling Out a Recession This Year — What Could That Mean for Your Wallet?\nTry This: 7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nAccording to Fidelity, a shrinking economy can cause a cascade of stressful ripple effects, including lower employment, deterioratingstock market resultsand higher borrowing costs for consumers and companies.\nFor boomers, navigating a downturn comes with its own set of challenges. Whether you’re nearing retirement, already enjoying it or somewhere in between, avoiding certain money mistakes can make all the difference.\n“I’ve worked with retirement planning for ages, and I keep seeing the same wealth-killing mistakes,” said Andrew Lokenauth, money expert and owner of BeFluentInFinance.\nBelow are some of the biggest financial slip-ups boomers should dodge when the economy hits a rough patch — and how to come out stronger on the other side.\nPanic Selling Is Absolute Poison to Your Portfolio\nWatching the market tumble can feel like you’re on a rollercoaster with no seatbelt.\nWhen the headlines scream “Recession Incoming!” and your retirement account starts shrinking, it’s natural to want to do something. But here’s the thing: Panic selling is usually the worst move you can make.\nLokenauth watched countless clients dump their stocks in March 2020 when everything crashed — and consequently miss out on one of the fastest recoveries ever. “Those knee-jerk reactions locked in permanent losses. Just terrible.”\nBe Aware: 6 Cash Flow Mistakes Boomers Are Making With Their Retirement Savings\nTaking Social Security Too Early\nTaking benefits early can shortchange you in a big way over the long haul.\nHere’s a reality check during a recession: Claiming early out of fear can limit your flexibility later on. Higher monthly benefits down the road could be crucial if the economy stays rocky, inflation eats into your savings or healthcare costs spike — which they often do.\n“Sure, the guaranteed income feels safe during scary times, but I’ve run the numbers hundreds of times,” said Lokenauth.\nHe said claiming at 62 instead of waiting till 70 can cost you $100,000 or more in lifetime benefits. “The math doesn’t lie.”\nRaiding Retirement Accounts Early\nSomething that Lokenauth said makes him cringe is raiding retirement accounts early.\nFirst off, if you pull money out of most retirement accounts before age 59½, you’ll likely get hit with a 10% early withdrawal penalty, plus you’ll owe regular income tax on that money.\nThat can be a nasty surprise come tax season — not exactly the relief you were hoping for.\nBut beyond the penalties, the bigger issue is this: Every dollar you take out now is a dollar — or more — you won’t have working for you later.\n“I had a client pull $50,000 from his IRA during the last recession for ‘safety.’ Between taxes, penalties and missing the recovery, that decision cost him about $130,000 in future wealth,” Lokenauth said. “Made me sick to watch it happen.”\nIgnoring Inflation Is Another Brutal Mistake\nYour cash might feel cozy sitting in a savings account, but it’s actually shrinking by 3% to 7% each year.\nWhen the economy takes a dip, it’s easy to get focused on immediate financial problems, like your job uncertainty or stock market drops. But here’s the truth: Inflation doesn’t stop just because the recession is in full swing.\nIn fact, it can make things even worse.\nFor boomers, you may already be on a fixed income or near retirement, and inflation is a silent thief. As the cost of living rises — whether it’s groceries, gas or healthcare — your money simply doesn’t stretch as far as it used to.\nAccording to Lokenauth, this means your purchasing power — the value of your money — is steadily shrinking. If you’re not actively planning for it, this can become a huge burden, especially over time.\nHe said he keeps about 6 months of expenses in cash. “Anything more is just bleeding value.”\nCutting Back on Maintenance and Healthcare\nOne mistake that gets overlooked, according to Lokenauth, is cutting back on maintenance and healthcare to save money.\nWhen times are tight, it’s natural to look for areas to cut costs. But some cuts can have long-term consequences — especially when it comes to maintenance and healthcare. Skimping on these crucial areas might save you a few bucks now, but, as Lokenauth put it: Those “savings” often lead to way bigger expenses down the road.\n“My uncle tried skipping his blood pressure meds to cut costs,” he said. “Ended up in the ER. Cost him $25,000.”\nOverall, he highlighted that protecting wealth in or approaching retirement isn’t about fancy strategies. It’s about avoiding big mistakes and staying disciplined when everyone else is losing their heads.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nMark Cuban: Trump's Tariffs Will Affect This Class of People the Most\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nHow To Get the Most Value From Your Costco Membership in 2025\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Money Mistakes Boomers Must Avoid in a Recession\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/4-massive-monthly-dividends-im-looking-right-now","Article":"Worried about the trade war and your retirement portfolio? Then I have two words for you: monthly dividends.\nToday we'll fawn over four monthly payers that yield up to 17.4% annually. That's no typo. Hop in my favorite income vehicle and we'll motor over this market carnage together.\nThe current market environment is nearly perfect for contrarians like us. How is that possible with tariff policy still, ahem, unfolding? Well the market is still full of fear and the weak hands have washed out.\nIf Everyone Wants to Panic-Sell to Us, We Should Let Them!\n\nIf you're worried that the fear is justified because we are heading for a recession, let's consider defensive stocks. They tend to be bear-resistant as their prices fall less than the market-at-large during a downdraft:\nHealth Care, Staples and Utilities Fell Less Than the Market\n\nIn other words: We contrarians should be looking to load up on anything that looks good in this environment, aggressive and defensive alike! That means buying more of the monthly dividends we already believe in, and looking for new opportunities.\nMonthly dividend stocks have a number of qualities we want during market turbulence:\nThey usually belong to specific high-yield categories, such as REITs, BDCs, and CEFs. That's more income offsetting losses in a bear market.\nThey pay more dividends more frequently, which means their income is more likely to buoy our portfolios when we need to see those returns the most.\nThey often have a higher level of cash-flow stability that allows them to make those more frequent distributions.\nI say \"usually\" and \"often\" because they don't always sport these properties. Monthly dividend stocks need just as much due diligence as any other to make sure we're not buying up portfolio time bombs.\nStill, the relative strength and 5.6%-17.4% distributions of these four monthly dividend stocks are a great starting point. Let's see how they stack up.\nRealty Income (O)\nDividend Yield: 5.6%\nRealty Income (O) is one of the bluest real estate blue chips--a $50 billion net-lease specialist with 15,600 commercial properties leased out to more than 1,500 clients in nearly 90 industries. It's also increasingly an international player, with more than 500 of those properties spread across a half-dozen European nations.\nA lot of that scale (of late) has come from large acquisitions, such as VEREIT in 2021, a large portfolio of properties from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust in 2023, and Spirit Realty Capital in 2024. But those acquisitions haven't yet yielded much fruit for shareholders, who are sitting on a mere 5% cumulative total return in a rocky four years and merely par real estate performance since COVID.\nGreat Organization, But What Have You Done for Shareholders Lately?\n\nIt's tough. On the one hand, Realty Income delivers a monthly dividend yielding nearly 6% (that it has raised for 110 consecutive quarters), has an extraordinarily diversified tenant base, enjoys the relative income stability of triple-net leases, boasts an outstanding balance sheet and, thanks to its scale, benefits from one of the best costs of capital in the space.\nOn the other hand, its growth in a good year is middling. And expectations for 2025 aren't even middling--Realty Income's own guidance for 2025 AFFO is $4.22-$4.28 per share, which represents just a 1.4% uptick at the midpoint.\nIf anything, Realty Income has held up too well this year. It's flat since the Feb. 19 market high, with the recent dip all but evaporating. So we're buying its yawn-worthy growth for 13 times AFFO estimates. Not ideal, at least for now.\nMain Street Capital Corp. (MAIN)\nDividend Yield: 7.8%\nBusiness development companies (BDCs) allow average investors like us to invest in private companies without having to pony up a million bucks. All we need is the money to cover at least a single share--often just $20 to $30.\nThe downside of the industry? It's a dogfight. Financing risky small businesses is, well, risky; many BDCs have put up shoddy returns over time. In fact, it's one industry I refuse to buy via funds because so many losers weigh down the winners. We just want the individual winners.\nMAIN has long been one of those winners--a true blue chip in a niche industry with generally small market caps. At roughly $5 billion, it is one of the largest BDCs we'll find.\nMain Street's primary investments are debt and equity capital solutions to lower-middle-market companies, as well as private loans to privately held companies. However, it also provides debt financing to middle-market firms and has an asset management advisory business. Its ideal portfolio company will generate revenues of between $25 million and $500 million annually, and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of between $7.5 million and $50 million.\nPortfolio breadth is high. MAIN currently is invested in 190 companies. Its largest holding represents just 3.8% of the total portfolio at fair value, and most investments are less than 1%. And those holdings are spread across several dozen industries, none of which make up more than 10% of the portfolio at cost.\nMAIN Shareholders Enjoy Wide Exposure to the Small Business World\n\nSource: Main Street Capital Corp. Q4 Investor Presentation\nMAIN's headline data gives us a lot to love. It has a nearly 8% dividend, 5.6 points of which come from its regular monthly distribution, and the rest of which comes from fairly regular quarterly specials--and both types of dividends have been on the rise. The stock historically clobbers the BDC industry, too; it's not outperforming the pack by much in the current downturn, but it is ahead. Liquidity is usually strong, leverage tends to be conservative,\nThe issue with Main Street almost any time we look at it is that it's laughably overpriced. Right now, it trades at a 70% (not a typo) premium to its net asset value (NAV), which makes it the most expensive BDC--by nearly 20 percentage points! I could argue that MAIN is always overpriced, but even by its own lofty standards, Main Street is priced for perfection.\nBut I'll also point out that, at the moment, Main Street's portfolio looks a little shaky. Non-accrual loans (not accruing interest because the loan is past due, usually by 90 days or more) are higher than the BDC average as a percent of the debt portfolio at both cost and fair value. This, heading into a potentially difficult economic environment, isn't making me boil over with optimism.\nGladstone Capital Corp. (GLAD)\nDividend Yield: 9.7%\nGladstone Capital Corp. (GLAD) is one of the five investment funds that make up the Gladstone family of companies, all of which deal in alternative investments (namely real estate and private equity\/debt). This particular Gladstone name is a business development company that invests in lower middle-market businesses.\nGladstone's ideal portfolio companies generate $20 million to $150 million in annual revenues, $3 million to $25 million in annual EBITDA, have a proven business model, limited market and\/or technology risk and a few other criteria. The BDC will provide financing in just about any way, too, though its primary focus is on first lien debt, which makes up roughly three-quarters of its portfolio.\nThat Preference for First Lien Debt Has Grown of Late, Too\n\nSource: Gladstone Capital Q4 2024 Investor Presentation\nThe BDC industry spent much of the past couple of years in recovery mode once the Fed took its foot off the interest-rate pedal. But Gladstone stood out as one of the industry's biggest winners, tripling the return of the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD) and nearly doubling up the broader market. It's deserved--Gladstone has been among the industry's best in NAV-per-share growth and return on equity. A combined yield of nearly 10% (~8% regular monthly dividends, ~2% special dividends) furthers the appeal.\nUnderstandably, GLAD had some froth to lose entering 2025, and it did. However, its drop into bear-market territory hasn't been nearly so bad as other BDC names.\nDespite the declines, Gladstone's shares still aren't a \"bargain,\" trading at a 14% premium to their net asset value. The company is one of the best operational performers in an industry peppered with duds, and its shares typically trade like it. However, Gladstone does tend to come back down to earth every so often, so let's keep an eye on it. We might eventually be able to pick it up at a slight discount.\nDynex Capital (DX)\nDividend Yield: 17.4%\nDynex Capital (DX) is another REIT, but one that deals in \"paper\" real estate. It's a mortgage real estate investment trust--one that invests almost exclusively (98%) in agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs).\nAgency MBSes, which are issued by government-sponsored enterprises such as Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae, are generally considered \"safer\" than non-agency mortgages, but they also generally pay lower rates. So, how does Dynex deliver a double-digit yield? In a word: leverage. Dynex closed out 2024 with leverage of 7.9x, which is simultaneously quite high and yet not too far above its historical average.\nAs I predicted in 2024, the steepening of the yield curve (that is, the gap between short- and long-term rates getting wider) over the past couple of years has been a boon for Dynex, which has made more of the environment than many other mREITs. I mentioned in December that Dynex finally reversed a history of dividend cuts with a 15% distribution hike, to 15 cents per share. And just a few months later, DX added another 13%, to 17 cents per share.\nShares have responded accordingly, right up until the tariff scare.\nThe Dividend Magnet Is Clearly Engaged, But ...\n\nAn issue for DX from here is rate uncertainty, though most expectations have been for more rate cuts than previously expected for 2025. Generally speaking, that should benefit mREITs because it provides a lower cost of borrowing and could improve the mortgage lending environment, but it could also spark prepayments (primarily through refinancing).\nThe short-term dip has made it more appealing to would-be buyers, though, with DX now trading at roughly 10 times earnings estimates.\nHow to Collect a $48,000 \"Portfolio Paycheck\" When You Retire\nThe current market environment puts a giant spotlight on the importance of security--but fortunately, it also allows us to buy that security for less than we normally could!\nI look to the best high-yielding monthly payers to offer that peace of mind because they can provide me with cash returns even if nothing else is working.\nThis recent slump has given me the perfect opportunity to stash away even more quality in my \"8%+ Monthly Payer Portfolio\"--a \"who's who\" of companies and funds that check off the \"3 H's\":\nHigh yields\nHigh quality\nHigh durability\nA lot of dividend portfolios try to offer up names that you know, and that you're comfortable with. But Wall Street's over-trodden blue chips tend to deliver relatively modest yields at high valuations ... not to mention, they always pay quarterly.\nMy 8%+ Monthly Payer Portfolio is filled with names that many investors have (wrongly) slept on--despite kicking out 8%+ dividends that roll our way each and every month.\nThat dividend schedule means when you're done collecting a regular workplace paycheck, you can quickly transition to collecting a regular \"portfolio paycheck\" of roughly $48,000 annually on just $600,000 invested--and that paycheck will still sync up with your monthly bills!\nDon't miss out on these terrific income plays while you can still get in at a bargain.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-agnico-aem-0","Article":"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAgnico Eagle Mines (AEM) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this gold mining company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Agnico is 17.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 33.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 28.1%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Agnico is 40.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 15.5%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Agnico. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 15.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Agnico a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Agnico is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/3-growth-stocks-down-more-25-buy-right-now","Article":"The marketwide sell-off has affected many stocks, but none more than tech stocks. Tech is one of the first places to get hit during a market sell-off, as it often trades at high valuations and has a lot of growth baked into it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML) have been sold off aggressively, slipping around 25%, 30%, and 40%, respectively.\nWhile some shareholders may see this as a time to panic, I think it's an excellent time to scoop up these stocks, as the price declines are mostly centered around fear, not facts.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\nInvestors are starting to see a lot more tariff relief\nMany investors fear that President Donald Trump's tariff plan will harm companies that source their goods outside the U.S. To offset the tariffs, the price of goods will rise, which means the consumer won't be able to purchase as much, harming pretty much every company.\nThat's the idea, but President Trump's team has already made several concessions over the past month. They have backed down from reciprocal tariffs (except for China), so now it's only a 10% rate across the board. However, many countries are negotiating with President Trump's team, and if a deal is struck, tariffs may be further reduced from the 10% level. Additionally, we're starting to see more carve-outs for specific products.\nThe White House exempted items like copper, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, and subsequently exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from the reciprocal tariffs targeted at China.\nSo, the worst-case scenario that investors imagined following the Liberation Day tariff announcement isn't happening, yet these stocks remain well off their all-time highs established earlier this year. In addition to tariffs likely not being as bad as feared, these three are all massive beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout.\nAI is still a massive driver for this trio\nAI has taken a backseat to tariff fears, but that trend is still occurring. The AI hyperscalers continue to build out massive computing power, as it's becoming clear that more computing power is necessary to continue innovating and improving current AI models.\nNvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that an estimated $400 billion was spent on data center buildouts during 2024. However, that figure is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. That's huge news for Nvidia, which generated around $131 billion in revenue over the past 12 months. If it can keep its market share, it will continue putting up massive growth figures over the next few years.\nWhile it's easy to dismiss Nvidia's growth predictions because it benefits the most, an even more reliable source is Taiwan Semiconductor. Taiwan Semi is the leading contract chip fabricator, producing chips for those who cannot fabricate them themselves, which is nearly all modern tech companies like Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Chip orders are placed years in advance, giving Taiwan Semi's management an unprecedented view into the future of the chip industry.\nThey project that AI-related revenue will grow at a 45% compound annual rate over the next five years and that overall growth will be nearly 20%. That's massive chip growth, and it confirms the data center buildout growth that Nvidia mentioned.\nIf the demand for chips grows that much, TSMC is going to need machines to fabricate chips. ASML is the only company on Earth that makes extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography machines used to lay the tiny electrical traces on chips. With ASML's technology, the chips that we enjoy today wouldn't be possible.\nThere is no competition for ASML, which gives it a technological monopoly in this space. This indicates ASML should see strong growth over the next few years, and it's time to take advantage of the sale price the market is providing.\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nFollowing the market sell-off, this trio is far cheaper than they once were. This should give investors the green light to begin scooping up shares, as this trio has massive growth ahead of it. Yet the stocks are trading for a much lower valuation than they were just a few months ago. If you've got some cash to deploy in the market, I can think of few better stocks to buy than these three.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

But as a best-selling author, he also knows a thing or two about the power of a good book. Robbins frequently stresses the value of reading and claimed in an interview to have devoured 700 books before he turned 18.\nDiscover More: 3 Signs You’ve ‘Made It’ Financially, According to Financial Influencer Genesis Hinckley\nCheck Out: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nA literary resume like that is too vast to chronicle concisely, so GOBankingRates highlighted the top three books that Robbins recommends for their ability to teach ordinary people extraordinary skills for success. \n‘The TB12 Method’ by Tom Brady\nAlthough Tony Robbins is not known for his athletic endeavors, one of his most recommended books is from none other than — sorry, Joe Montana fans — the undisputed greatest quarterback of all time: Tom Brady.\nOn his Facebook page, which was linked to an endorsement of the book “The TB12 Method,” Robbins referred to Brady as his “dear friend.” On his YouTube channel, Robbins revealed why he doesn’t think it matters that Brady’s specialty is football because his true skill is winning. \n“Now in his 40s and still considered one of the best quarterbacks in the nation, Tom Brady knows a thing or two about performing at an elite level,” Robbins wrote. “In this book, Tom Brady discusses his strategies for succeeding on and off the field.”\nRead Next: I’m a Financial Advisor — My Wealthiest Clients All Do These 3 Things\n‘As A Man Thinketh’ by James Allen\n“As A Man Thinketh” is a classic that delves into the art of thinking. It reveals how — when pursued as a skill and a science — critical thinking can solve every problem a person encounters. \nRobbins wrote on his Facebook page, “‘As a Man Thinketh’ by James Allen is a book everyone should read. I’ve read it more than a dozen times and I often gift it because it’s concise, easy to read, but also deeply profound. For anyone who wants to understand how your thoughts really, truly shape everything in your life that you feel and experience, this book is a must-read.”\n‘Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail’ by Ray Dalio\nLike Tom Brady, Ray Dalio’s niche is not one that most people aspire to — but as the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, his true specialty is success.\nAlso like Brady, Robbins believes ordinary people can apply the lessons of Dalio’s book “Principles” to any endeavor they pursue. On the book’s official page, Amazon quotes Robbins as saying, “Ray Dalio has an uncanny capacity to understand what is happening in the world and develop principles that allow him to prepare for what’s ahead. ‘Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order’ is a must-read full of insights into where the world is today and where it’s going.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Types of Vehicles Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 3 Books Tony Robbins Has Recommended — and What You Can Learn From Them\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis holding company for Pennsylvania-based Community Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.43 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -30.7%.\nRevenues are expected to be $12.5 million, down 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CB Financial Services?\nFor CB Financial Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.18%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CB Financial Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that CB Financial Services would post earnings of $0.46 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.35, delivering a surprise of -23.91%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nCB Financial Services doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Northeast industry, Midland States Bancorp (MSBI) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.52 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -1.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $72.75 million, down 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Midland States Bancorp has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -5.77%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Midland States Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in CB Financial Services, Inc.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/bit-digital-btbt-buy-wall-street-analysts-look-optimistic-0","Article":"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Bit Digital, Inc. (BTBT) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nBit Digital currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by five brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.00 indicates Strong Buy.\nOf the five recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy, representing 100% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for BTBT\n\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Bit Digital here>>>\n\nThe ABR suggests buying Bit Digital, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nShould You Invest in BTBT?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Bit Digital, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$0.02.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Bit Digital. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Bit Digital.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/are-you-looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-236","Article":"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\nHancock Whitney in Focus\nHancock Whitney (HWC) is headquartered in Gulfport, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -11.09% since the start of the year. The holding company of Whitney Bank and Hancock Bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.45 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.7%. This compares to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.59% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.80 is up 20% from last year. Hancock Whitney has increased its dividend 2 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 9.80%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Hancock Whitney's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nEarnings growth looks solid for HWC for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $5.44 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 2.26%.\nBottom Line\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, HWC is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/bitcoin-covenants-txhash-and-checktxhashverifybip-346","Article":"Bitcoin Magazine\n\nBitcoin Covenants: TXHASH And CHECKTXHASHVERIFY(BIP 346)\nThis is the third article in a series deep diving into individual covenant proposals that have reached a point of maturity meriting an in-depth breakdown.\nTXHASH and CHECKTXHASHVERIFY (TXHASH), put forward by Steven Roose and Brandon Black with a BIP number currently unassigned, is a “template based” covenant that can conceptually seen as an extension or more advanced version of CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV). \nBefore getting into the nitty gritty of how TXHASH works, let’s refresh on the pieces of data in a Bitcoin transaction. \nAt a high level you have the outputs, the inputs, and the witness (or script sig for non-Segwit transactions in the input). \nGlobal transaction fields:\nVersion\nMarker, indicating Segwit with a flag value\nFlag, indicating Segwit with a flag value\nInput count\nOutput count\nnLocktime, used for timelocks\nEach input contains:\nTXID of the previous transaction\nVOUT (index) of the output from that transaction being spent\nScriptSig size\nScriptSig (if a non-segwit transaction)\nSequence number (used for RBF flagging and relative timelocks).\nEach output contains:\nAmount of satoshis assigned to the output\nScriptPubKeySize, the size of the locking script\nScriptPubkey, the actual locking script\nWe can ignore the witness field when considering TXHASH or CHECKTXHASHVERIFY as neither opcode constrains the witness field to retain certain properties. \nHow TXHASH Works\nBoth TXHASH (tapscript only) and CHECKTXHASHVERIFY (legacy script and tapscript) have different behaviors on the stack because of the differences between legacy script and tapscript. For the purposes of this article, these differences are not material, so we are simply going to ignore them.\nIf CTV is a covenant opcode that constrains a bitcoin output to only be spent in a singular and exactly defined way, TXHASH is a supercharged version of CTV that lets you pick and choose exactly what pieces of a transaction are constrained and must be spent in the exactly pre-defined way, and which pieces of a transaction can be whatever someone wants at spending time. \nIt gives you the best of both worlds, requiring something be done when spending a covenant restricted coin, but then allowing a user to do whatever they want with the rest of the funds available to them or the transaction they are crafting. \nThis is accomplished using the ‘TxFieldSelector’. \nCTV simply uses a single hash of the pre-defined transaction in order to verify at spending time. With TXHASH, you need a way to communicate what pieces of information that hash is committing to, and what pieces of information it is not. That is the TxFieldSelector’s job. \nTxFieldSelector is essentially a series of bytes (that can be variable in length), with each bit communicating what fields in a transaction are committed to by the hash that will be verified against. This allows you to select specific fields of the transaction, nLocktime, version etc. It lets you select specific fields of the inputs and outputs, i.e. include or not the sequence number, or the previous output id, or the taproot annex (a datafield specific to taproot scripts). The outputs, whether to commit to the ScriptPubkey, the amount values, both, or neither. You can also decide exactly which outputs and inputs these restrictions apply to. \nThere is some complexity and flexibility in how the TxFieldSelector is put together, and you can read all the finer details here in the proposed BIP if you’re interested in those, but the chief point to take away is it allows you to pick exactly which parts of the transaction are restricted by the covenant when someone goes to spend the encumbered output, and which parts are not, to a very granular degree. \nWhat Is TXHASH Useful For\nFirstly, TXHASH allows you to do everything that you can with CTV. So all of the value provided by CTV to optimize the coordination costs of anything currently possible with pre-signed transactions is also provided by TXHASH. But it supercharges that capability massively. Instead of having to commit to the entirety of a transaction, you can commit to just the parts you care about. \nThis has two big benefits in theory right off the bat. First of all, in band fee management for layer twos becomes easier to deal with. Currently the use of anchor outputs is required to fee-bump layer two settlement transactions with Child Pays For Parent, where a transaction spending an output from an unconfirmed one can add to the net fees for both. TXHASH lets you commit to only your counterparties outputs in a multiparty transaction, and leave yours free to do whatever you want with (caveat here that other things must be done to make this safe so a third party can’t burn all of your funds to fees), including decrementing slightly to RBF the transaction. \nSecond, the door is now open for multiparty protocols to allow granular guarantees about what off-chain transactions are committing to. Some users can now receive a guarantee about how their coins will be spent, but not have to care about what some other group of users does with theirs. I can be sure that one TxFieldSelector guarantees my coins are handled properly, and I don’t have to care about where anyone else’s coins go. \nIn combination with CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS), TXHASH can facilitate a completely generalized SIGHASH system. The SIGHASH flag is a part of a signature that communicates what parts of the transaction to check the signature against. They are currently: \nSIGHASH_ALL – signs all inputs and outputs\nSIGHASH_NONE – signs all inputs and no outputs\nSIGHASH_SINGLE – signs all inputs and the output with the same index as this input\nNone of these SIGHASH flags allow adding any new inputs to a transaction without invalidating them, but each has an ANYONECANPAY version that only signs its own input and the appropriate outputs, allowing anyone else to then add new inputs, and new outputs for the ANYONECANPAY version of SIGHASH_NONE and SIGHASH_SINGLE.\nBy being able to “sideload” new TxFieldSelectors using CSFS, users can emulate a SIGHASH system that allows them to pick and choose exactly which individual pieces of a transaction the signature commits to or not. \nTXHASH also allows enforcing equality between the value of inputs and outputs by using individual TxFieldSelectors that commit only to a single value field of an input or output you wish to inspect, and then ensuring their hashes are the same on the stack. \nClosing Thoughts\nTXHASH is a potential supercharging of CTV, enabling an incredibly granular degree of introspection of the spending transaction which can be incredibly powerful, especially in combination with something like CSFS. \nHowever, that power is expressive enough that it opens up the door to an incredibly large design space. One that could potentially have a material effect on the overall incentives of Bitcoin.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/biomx-phge-may-find-bottom-soon-heres-why-you-should-buy-stock-now","Article":"Shares of BiomX Inc. (PHGE) have been struggling lately and have lost 7.9% over the past two weeks. However, a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session, which could mean that the stock found support with bulls being able to counteract the bears. So, it could witness a trend reversal down the road.\nWhile the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this company is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.\nUnderstanding Hammer Chart and the Technique to Trade It\nThis is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'\nIn simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.\nWhen it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.\nHammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.\nLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.\nHere's What Increases the Odds of a Turnaround for PHGE\nThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for PHGE lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 34.9%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering PHGE are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.\nIf this is not enough, you should note that PHGE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nMoreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for BiomX is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/better-artificial-intelligence-stock-ionq-vs-palantir-technologies","Article":"The current times are exciting for technology investors. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing could be a glimpse of a looming golden era of innovation. IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) have great storylines -- both are working to establish themselves as leaders in these new markets.\nThese stocks have already generated exhilarating returns. IonQ is up 650% since 2023, while Palantir has surged over 1,300%.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\nThe past couple of years might only be the beginning. Experts believe artificial intelligence could grow to become a multitrillion-dollar industry over the next decade and beyond. Which is the better AI stock to choose for the long haul? Neither is perfect, but the facts ultimately reveal a clear choice.\nTwo different companies, both at the forefront of AI\nIn a way, artificial intelligence is software that can do more than people have ever dreamed possible. AI models can now think, analyze data, and even generate written content and images. Who knows what it will do even a couple of years from now? IonQ and Palantir are pushing the bleeding edge of innovation in separate ways.\nPalantir builds customer AI software applications for government and commercial applications. It takes data and analyzes it to produce actionable insights in real time. As a result, Palantir's AI software is highly adaptable to countless use cases. It can assist military missions, coordinate people and schedules, optimize supply chains, detect fraudulent activities, you name it. The company is highly profitable, its growth has accelerated since the summer of 2023, and Palantir could still be in the early chapters of a long growth story.\nIonQ is racing to become a major player in quantum computing, which could eventually be crucial to unlocking AI's full potential. Quantum computers use quantum mechanics to produce capabilities far exceeding today's best supercomputers. IonQ is developing quantum computers for data centers. It's still early. Today's quantum computers are unstable and prone to errors. IonQ is racing to hone its technology and be among the first companies to bring commercially practical quantum computers to the market.\nEach stock has a significant flaw\nComparing these two AI stocks is interesting because both have significant flaws despite their compelling performance over the past two years.\nFor IonQ, investors are putting a ton of faith into the unknown. Frankly, quantum computing isn't ready for the real world yet. CEOs like Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai have speculated that practical quantum computing could be years away. (Huang later walked back his statement.) That helps explain why IonQ generated just $43 million in revenue last year.\nQuantum computing may eventually be a massive opportunity. Still, it's unclear when the market will take off, how much IonQ will capture, or how profitable IonQ will be. At IonQ's $6 billion market cap, it's a guess as to what you're getting for your investment.\nPalantir doesn't have this problem. The business generated $2.87 billion in revenue last year, and growth is speeding up. Palantir also oozes free cash flow and net income. The problem with Palantir is the price investors must pay to own the stock. Remember, even the world's best company can be a lousy investment if the valuation stinks.\nThe stock's past returns are impressive, but that epic run pushed Palantir's valuation through orbit. The stock's current price-to-sales ratio (80) and forward price-to-earnings ratio (167) are egregious and require years of high-octane growth or a dramatic share price decline to rightsize.\nHowever, the superior business is clear, as is the winner in this AI stock face-off\nAt this point, Palantir is the superior business. Perhaps IonQ will challenge it in the future, but it seems that time may be years away.\nPalantir stock's valuation is a bit radioactive right now, but the strong company behind it gives investors something to work with. Therefore, it's also the better AI stock.\nThat doesn't mean investors should buy shares today. The market has become shaky in recent weeks. If investors do shy away from riskier growth and technology stocks, Palantir will likely sell off harder due to that valuation. Shares have already declined nearly 25% from their high.\nPalantir could drop another 50% from here, and it would still be one of the most expensive stocks on Wall Street. So, there's no rush. Formulate a plan to buy slowly as the stock declines (or the business grows) and drifts closer to a far more reasonable valuation.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/beaten-down-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-just-got-some-great-news-time-buy","Article":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over the world. Individuals and corporations are implementing the technology in their day-to-day lives and operations; governmental institutions are doing the same. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced it would phase out animal testing in drug development in favor of other methods, including AI-based testing.\nThat's good news for Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX), a biotech company that's already pioneering the use of AI in drug development. Recursion's shares soared on the news, but the stock remains down significantly over the trailing-12-month period. Should investors purchase shares today?\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\nMore details on Recursion's approach\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals built the largest AI supercomputer in the pharmaceutical industry with the help of tech giant Nvidia. The company's operating system (OS) features a library of human genes, and helps predict whether various clinical compounds would effectively treat certain diseases. The most promising compounds get to move on to clinical trials.\nIt can take a while for drugmakers to move their programs to clinical studies after the inception phase. Recursion claims that its approach can significantly decrease the time and money that typically goes into this phase. If true, that would mean stronger revenue for drugmakers, since their therapies would spend more time on the market before losing patent exclusivity.\nLower expenses associated with drug development would also translate into higher profits and margins for pharmaceutical leaders.\nRecursion could also build a network effect within its OS by fine-tuning it following the success (or failure) of the clinical compound it predicted would perform well in studies.\nOne of Recursion's goals is to license its OS out to other pharmaceutical companies, a business that would carry far higher margins than developing drugs. That's why the recent decision from the FDA is such a big deal for the company. Recursion is ahead of its time; if things go well, it could help revolutionize how drugs are developed and make a fortune while delivering excellent results to its shareholders.\nRisk-averse investors should look elsewhere\nThat said, there's more to the story. While Recursion looks more attractive than it did a month ago, thanks to these recent developments, the stock is hardly a slam dunk at this point.\nFor one thing, despite its claims that its approach can cut the time (and the money) required to develop drugs, it has yet to produce tangible results. Recursion doesn't have a single drug on the market. Worse, it doesn't even have any investigational candidates in phase 3 studies. It's hard to make convincing claims about transforming the way we develop drugs without having crossed the final clinical and regulatory roadblocks leading to approval.\nFurthermore, now that the FDA is moving in this direction, it will likely incentivize other companies to build their own AI initiatives. Some have already made significant strides in that direction. Novo Nordisk helped build a supercomputer in Denmark, where it's based, to help accelerate innovation in the medical field. We can expect more developments along those lines from corporations with far more money than Recursion.\nTrue, the biotech has a first-mover advantage and the backing of several major players in the pharmaceutical industry, including Roche Holding, Bayer, Merck, and Sanofi. These partnerships make it less likely that the smaller biotech will run into funding issues, but they hardly make the stock attractive. Recursion's shares could skyrocket provided its master plan comes to fruition, but they could also remain southbound if it fails to deliver solid clinical and regulatory progress.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals isn't for risk-averse investors. But if you're comfortable with heightened volatility, you might consider initiating a small position in the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Recursion Pharmaceuticals right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Recursion Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/banco-bilbao-viscaya-argentaria-bbva-stock-outpacing-its-finance-peers-year","Article":"For those looking to find strong Finance stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Has Banco Bilbao (BBVA) been one of those stocks this year? By taking a look at the stock's year-to-date performance in comparison to its Finance peers, we might be able to answer that question.\nBanco Bilbao is one of 859 individual stocks in the Finance sector. Collectively, these companies sit at #5 in the Zacks Sector Rank. The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.\nThe Zacks Rank is a proven model that highlights a variety of stocks with the right characteristics to outperform the market over the next one to three months. The system emphasizes earnings estimate revisions and favors companies with improving earnings outlooks. Banco Bilbao is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for BBVA's full-year earnings has moved 10.4% higher within the past quarter. This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock's earnings outlook is improving.\nBased on the latest available data, BBVA has gained about 38.7% so far this year. Meanwhile, stocks in the Finance group have lost about 2.9% on average. This means that Banco Bilbao is performing better than its sector in terms of year-to-date returns.\nAnother stock in the Finance sector, Bank First Corporation (BFC), has outperformed the sector so far this year. The stock's year-to-date return is 7.3%.\nOver the past three months, Bank First Corporation's consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 8.2%. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nLooking more specifically, Banco Bilbao belongs to the Banks - Foreign industry, a group that includes 66 individual stocks and currently sits at #19 in the Zacks Industry Rank. On average, this group has gained an average of 8.9% so far this year, meaning that BBVA is performing better in terms of year-to-date returns.\nBank First Corporation, however, belongs to the Banks - Northeast industry. Currently, this 73-stock industry is ranked #53. The industry has moved -14.1% so far this year.\nBanco Bilbao and Bank First Corporation could continue their solid performance, so investors interested in Finance stocks should continue to pay close attention to these stocks.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/autonation-expected-beat-earnings-estimates-what-know-ahead-q1-release","Article":"AutoNation (AN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis auto retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6%.\nRevenues are expected to be $6.44 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.69% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AutoNation?\nFor AutoNation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.32%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that AutoNation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that AutoNation would post earnings of $4.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.97, delivering a surprise of +16.67%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAutoNation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAnother stock from the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Whole Sales industry, Sonic Automotive (SAH), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.38 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.47 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for Sonic Automotive has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.82%.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Sonic Automotive will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in AutoNation, Inc.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/are-you-value-investor-1-stock-could-be-perfect-pick-490","Article":"For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.\nFeaturing daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.\nZacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nFor value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\nVGM Score\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\nIt's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nThis totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\nSince the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: Synovus Financial (SNV)\nFounded in 1888, Columbus, GA-based Synovus Financial Corp. is a diverse financial services company that conducts its banking operations through Synovus Bank. It provides integrated financial services, including commercial and consumer banking, investment, and mortgage services, to its customers through locally branded divisions of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Synovus Bank, which has 246 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\nSNV is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P\/E ratio of 8.51; value investors should take notice.\nFor fiscal 2025, three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.03 to $4.85 per share. SNV boasts an average earnings surprise of 14.6%.\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, SNV should be on investors' short list.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/are-you-looking-top-momentum-pick-why-agnico-eagle-mines-aem-great-choice-0","Article":"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Agnico Eagle Mines currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AEM that show why this gold mining company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\nFor AEM, shares are up 18.26% over the past week while the Zacks Mining - Gold industry is up 14.44% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 15.29% compares favorably with the industry's 8.33% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Agnico Eagle Mines have risen 37.01%, and are up 91.48% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -11.63% and 6.63%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of AEM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AEM is averaging 4,093,077 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with AEM.\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AEM's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.99 to $5.63 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AEM is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Agnico Eagle Mines on your short list.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/are-you-looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-238","Article":"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\nBar Harbor Bankshares in Focus\nHeadquartered in Bar Harbor, Bar Harbor Bankshares (BHB) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -5.23% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.3 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 4.14%. In comparison, the Banks - Northeast industry's yield is 3.2%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.69%.\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.20 is up 1.7% from last year. Bar Harbor Bankshares has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.74%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Bar Harbor's current payout ratio is 42%. This means it paid out 42% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nEarnings growth looks solid for BHB for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $2.84 per share, with earnings expected to increase 0.35% from the year ago period.\nBottom Line\nFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, BHB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

The stock has seen a price change of -6.81% since the start of the year. The financial services company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.75 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.16%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 1.86% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nIn terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3 is up 5.3% from last year.

This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\nVGM Score\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: MasTec (MTZ)\nMasTec, Inc. is a leading infrastructure construction company operating mainly throughout North America. The company engages in the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of energy, communication, utility and other infrastructure.\nMTZ is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. MTZ has a Growth Style Score of A, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 40.5% for the current fiscal year.\nFor fiscal 2025, two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.02 to $5.55 per share.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/analysts-estimate-rithm-ritm-report-decline-earnings-what-look-out","Article":"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Rithm (RITM) reports results for the quarter ended March 2025. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25, 2025, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.1%.\nRevenues are expected to be $1.14 billion, down 11.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.19% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Rithm?\nFor Rithm, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.08%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Rithm will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Rithm would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.60, delivering a surprise of +33.33%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nRithm doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, SouthState (SSB) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.43 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -9.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $604.47 million, up 45.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for SouthState has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -23.21%.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that SouthState will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nShould You Invest in Rithm Capital Corp.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/applovin-corporation-app-attracting-investor-attention-here-what-you-should-know-7","Article":"AppLovin (APP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this mobile app technology company have returned -22.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Technology Services industry, to which AppLovin belongs, has lost 25.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, AppLovin is expected to post earnings of $1.45 per share, indicating a change of +116.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +47.5%. This estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.25 indicates a change of +38.5% from what AppLovin is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for AppLovin.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of AppLovin, the consensus sales estimate of $1.38 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +30.2%. The $5.59 billion and $6.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.6% and +19%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAppLovin reported revenues of $1.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44%. EPS of $1.73 for the same period compares with $0.49 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.62%. The EPS surprise was +29.1%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAppLovin is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about AppLovin.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/applied-materials-inc-amat-trending-stock-facts-know-betting-it-8","Article":"Applied Materials (AMAT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of chipmaking equipment have returned -11%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Applied Materials falls in, has lost 14.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Applied Materials is expected to post earnings of $2.31 per share, indicating a change of +10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.35 points to a change of +8.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.90 indicates a change of +5.9% from what Applied Materials is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Applied Materials.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Applied Materials, the consensus sales estimate of $7.11 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7%. The $28.81 billion and $30.36 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6% and +5.4%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nApplied Materials reported revenues of $7.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.8%. EPS of $2.38 for the same period compares with $2.13 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.18%. The EPS surprise was +4.39%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApplied Materials is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Applied Materials. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/apple-gets-some-relief-president-trumps-tariffs-could-turn-stock-around","Article":"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) hasn't been able to escape the marketwide sell-off, and is down around 20% from its all-time highs. There was considerable concern about how the company would fare because many of its electronics are manufactured in China. Apple has struggled to grow sales recently, and any price increase in its base product would have made that situation even worse.\nHowever, Apple got some good news over the weekend: Smartphones and other electronics are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. That means the iPhone won't be going up in price by 145%, which is the current tariff rate on China (although that's subject to change, as we've found out).\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\nIs this a big enough announcement to turn the stock around? Or is there something else that investors need to watch out for?\niPhones are still getting hit with a tariff, but not at the 145% level\nLike most announcements about U.S. tariff policies, not all information is available at once. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick noted that the exceptions for electronic devices were only temporary. Eventually, they would be included in a semiconductor-specific tariff that will be announced within a month or two. While this gives Apple some breathing room for now, some other form of tariff is coming down the pipeline eventually.\nSo Apple's stock isn't roaring higher, because we're in another round of \"wait and see\" with tariffs.\nPresident Donald Trump is concerned about all tech manufacturing being done outside of U.S. borders, which his administration says is a national security risk. Apple is taking steps to move more of its manufacturing back to the U.S., and announced a $500 billion investment over the next four years to build facilities across the U.S. that will produce its products.\nWe'll see if this buys Apple some grace from the Trump administration, but based on Trump's language surrounding its situation, exemptions won't be handed out at all. So there could still be some issues with Apple's products rising in price to offset the effects of tariffs, which would not help sales.\nApple still has a premium valuation despite its slow sales growth\nApple's sales growth has been nearly nonexistent over the past three years:\nAAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\nWith Apple just now reaching its COVID-era sales peak, it will have to battle tariffs to return to this threshold. We don't know much about how the company believes tariffs will affect its sales, but we'll find out more on May 1 when it reports fiscal second-quarter sales (for the quarter ending in March 2025).\nEven with the stock falling 20% and sales being flat over the past three years, Apple's stock still fetches a premium valuation based on price to earnings:\nAAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\nAt 28 times forward earnings, Apple's stock is far from cheap, although it's much more attractive than it has been for most of the past year. It also has a significant premium to the broader market, which trades at 20.1 times forward earnings (as measured by the S&P 500).\nUntil we hear more from management following Q2 earnings, or get clarity on upcoming semiconductor tariffs, I think it's best to avoid the stock. There aren't any new products or features driving Apple's growth, and consumers are already stretched thin, which makes price increases problematic. However, Apple may need to hike prices anyway to offset the effects of tariffs, or eat into its margins.\nEither way, Apple's stock will suffer, so investors should be patient before purchasing shares.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $524,747!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $622,041!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 792% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 153% for the S&P 500.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis insurance brokerage is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.7%.\nRevenues are expected to be $4.86 billion, up 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and\/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aon?\nFor Aon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.24%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aon would post earnings of $4.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.42, delivering a surprise of +4.25%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, Willis Towers Watson (WTW) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.23 per share for the quarter ended March 2025. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -1.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.31 billion, down 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Willis Towers Watson has been revised 4% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -3.06%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Willis Towers Watson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/investors-heavily-search-rivian-automotive-inc-rivn-here-what-you-need-know-2","Article":"Rivian Automotive (RIVN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this a manufacturer of motor vehicles and passenger cars have returned +6.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Rivian Automotive belongs, has lost 0.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Rivian Automotive is expected to post a loss of $0.80 per share, indicating a change of +32.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of -$2.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$2.12 indicates a change of +26.2% from what Rivian Automotive is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Rivian Automotive.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Rivian Automotive, the consensus sales estimate of $1.03 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -14.8%. The $5.46 billion and $7.93 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.9% and +45.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nRivian Automotive reported revenues of $1.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +31.9%. EPS of -$0.52 for the same period compares with -$1.36 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +21.5%. The EPS surprise was +21.21%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nRivian Automotive is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Rivian Automotive. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/kingsoft-cloud-kc-upgraded-buy-what-does-it-mean-stock","Article":"Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited Sponsored ADR (KC) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\nThe power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Kingsoft Cloud is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor Kingsoft Cloud, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for Kingsoft Cloud\nThis company is expected to earn -$0.32 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2025, which represents a year-over-year change of 28.9%.\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Kingsoft Cloud. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.8%.\nBottom Line\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\nThe upgrade of Kingsoft Cloud to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance.

(U) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this company have returned -8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Unity Software belongs, has lost 13% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Unity Software is expected to post a loss of $0.37 per share, indicating a change of -346.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.8% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of -$1.07 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +36.3%. This estimate has changed +4.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.03 indicates a change of +3.9% from what Unity Software is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Unity Software.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Unity Software, the consensus sales estimate of $411.93 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -10.5%. The $1.77 billion and $1.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.3% and +8.4%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nUnity Software reported revenues of $457.1 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -25%. EPS of -$0.30 for the same period compares with $0.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $431.77 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.87%. The EPS surprise was +14.29%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nUnity Software is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Unity Software. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this property and casualty insurance holding company have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, which HCI Group falls in, has lost 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection.

So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor HCI Group, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $210.17 million indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/lakeland-financial-lkfn-could-be-great-choice-0","Article":"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\nWhile cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.\nLakeland Financial in Focus\nBased in Warsaw, Lakeland Financial (LKFN) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -22.89%. The holding company for Lake City Bank is paying out a dividend of $0.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.77% compared to the Banks - Midwest industry's yield of 3.6% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nLooking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2 is up 4.2% from last year. Lakeland Financial has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12.44%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Lakeland Financial's payout ratio is 55%, which means it paid out 55% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nLooking at this fiscal year, LKFN expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $3.70 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.63%.\nBottom Line\nInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.\nBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, LKFN is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/intuitive-surgical-inc-isrg-trending-stock-facts-know-betting-it-7","Article":"Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical falls in, has lost 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Intuitive Surgical is expected to post earnings of $1.71 per share, indicating a change of +14% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.37 indicates a change of +17.6% from what Intuitive Surgical is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Intuitive Surgical, the consensus sales estimate of $2.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +15.4%. The $9.56 billion and $10.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.4% and +14.9%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nIntuitive Surgical reported revenues of $2.41 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +25.2%. EPS of $2.21 for the same period compares with $1.60 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.02%. The EPS surprise was +24.86%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nIntuitive Surgical is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this technology and consulting company have returned -1.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 14.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/interdigital-idcc-upgraded-strong-buy-what-does-it-mean-stock","Article":"InterDigital (IDCC) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for InterDigital is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor InterDigital, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for InterDigital\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2025, this wireless research and development company is expected to earn $10.17 per share, which is a change of -32.1% from the year-ago reported number.\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for InterDigital. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 53.3%.\nBottom Line\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\nThe upgrade of InterDigital to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

Analysts forecast revenues of $17.76 billion, representing a decrease of 2.7% year over year.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some PepsiCo metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Net revenue- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region' will reach $1.06 billion. The estimate points to a change of -0.2% from the year-ago quarter.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Net revenue- Frito-Lay North America' should arrive at $5.56 billion. The estimate points to a change of -2.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Net revenue- Quaker Foods North America' at $639.21 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.8%.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net revenue- Africa, Middle East and South Asia' reaching $1.00 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -3.4% year over year.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net revenue- PepsiCo Beverages North America' should come in at $5.81 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -1.1% from the prior-year quarter.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net revenue- Europe' will reach $1.88 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.7% from the prior-year quarter.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Net revenue- Latin America' will reach $1.83 billion. The estimate points to a change of -11.3% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region' stands at $237.38 million. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $233 million in the same quarter last year.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Frito-Lay North America' of $1.48 billion. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported $1.58 billion in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAnalysts forecast 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Latin America' to reach $432.14 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $490 million.\nAnalysts expect 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Africa, Middle East and South Asia' to come in at $154.83 million. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $152 million.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Operating income (Non-GAAP)- Europe' will likely reach $214.72 million.

This can include executives in the c-suite and large hedge funds. These insiders are required to let the public know of their transactions via a Form 4 filing, which must be filed within two business days of the transaction.\nWhen a company insider makes a new purchase, that is an indication that they expect the stock to rise.\nInsider sells, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down.\nThe Insider's Guide to Important Transaction Codes\nSurveying the realm of stock transactions, investors often give prominence to those unfolding in the open market, systematically detailed in Table I of the Form 4 filing.

This bill was received on 2025-04-03, and currently has 2 cosponsors.\nHere is a short summary of the bill:\n\nThis bill, known as the Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange Act or DELETE Act, aims to enhance privacy protections for individuals by establishing a centralized system for the deletion of personal data held by data brokers. Here’s a summary of what the bill entails:\n\n\nData Broker Registration\n\n\nWithin one year of the bill's enactment, data brokers will be required to:\n\n\n\nRegister annually with the Federal Trade Commission and provide specific information such as their contact details and data collection practices.\n\n\nDisclose if they allow individuals to opt out of data collection and how those individuals can exercise that right.\n\n\n\nThis information is intended to be publicly accessible in a machine-readable format, promoting transparency regarding the activities of data brokers.\n\n\nCentralized Data Deletion System\n\n\nThe bill mandates the establishment of a centralized system that will:\n\n\n\nAllow individuals to request the deletion of their personal information from all registered data brokers with a single submission.\n\n\nProvide a standardized form for these requests, ensuring ease of use for individuals seeking privacy protections.\n\n\nImplement security measures to protect submitted personal information from unauthorized use.\n\n\n\nPersonal Information Deletion\n\n\nWhen a deletion request is submitted, data brokers will have to:\n\n\n\nDelete the requested personal information within 31 days of the request.\n\n\nDiscontinue any future collection of this information unless otherwise specified by the individual.\n\n\n\nData brokers will need to report to the Federal Trade Commission on how many deletion requests they complete each year.\n\n\nAudit and Compliance\n\n\nThe bill requires data brokers to undergo independent audits for compliance with the new data deletion requirements every three years. These audits will assess how well data brokers are adhering to the established protocols for handling personal information.\n\n\nFees and Funding\n\n\nData brokers will pay an annual fee to access the centralized system, which will be capped at 1% of the expected annual operating cost of the system. Funds collected through these fees will be used to maintain the centralized system and promote public awareness of privacy options.\n\n\nEnforcement Mechanisms\n\n\nViolations of the regulations set forth by this bill will be treated as unfair or deceptive acts under existing laws. The Federal Trade Commission will have the authority to enforce compliance and impose penalties on data brokers that do not follow the established regulations.\n\n\nStudies and Reports\n\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is tasked with conducting studies and reports on the effectiveness of the centralized deletion system and compliance rates. These reports will be submitted to congressional committees to inform lawmakers about the status and efficiency of privacy protections.\n\n\nState Law Preemption\n\n\nThe bill preempts state privacy laws that are inconsistent with its provisions. However, if a state law offers greater protections than this act, such state law will continue to apply.\n\n\nDefinitions and Clarifications\n\n\nThe bill provides definitions for key terms such as \"data broker,\" \"personal information,\" and various processes involved in handling personal data to clarify the scope of the legislation and the responsibilities of data brokers.\n\n\nRelevant Companies\n\n\nNone found.\nSenator Bill Cassidy Bill Proposals\nHere are some bills which have recently been proposed by Senator Bill Cassidy:\nS.1459: A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve the historic rehabilitation tax credit, and for other purposes.\nS.1425: A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the exception for de minimis payments by third party settlement organizations.\nS.1406: A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve the payment method for oxygen and oxygen related equipment, supplies, and services, to increase beneficiary access to oxygen and oxygen related equipment, supplies, and services, and for other purposes.\nS.1355: A bill to prescribe judicial review requirements for certain projects, and for other purposes.\nS.1325: A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a fee on certain products imported into the United States based on the pollution intensity associated with the production of such products, and for other purposes.\nS.1291: CLEAN FTZ Act of 2025\nSenator Bill Cassidy Net Worth\nQuiver Quantitative estimates that Senator Bill Cassidy is worth $447.5K, as of April 18th, 2025.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/new-bill-representative-troy-e-nehls-introduces-hr-2735-strengthening-child-exploitation","Article":"We have received text from H.R. 2735: Strengthening Child Exploitation Enforcement Act. This bill was received on 2025-04-08, and currently has 4 cosponsors.\nHere is a short summary of the bill:\n\nThis bill, known as the Strengthening Child Exploitation Enforcement Act, proposes amendments to various sections of Title 18 of the United States Code related to offenses involving children, specifically focusing on kidnapping, sexual abuse, and illicit sexual conduct. The main components of the bill include the following changes:\n\n\nKidnapping and Defraud\n\n\nThe bill expands the definition of kidnapping to include the concept of obtaining a person by \"defrauding or deceiving\" them. This means that if someone tricks or deceives a person into going with them, it can also be considered kidnapping, in addition to the traditional understanding of abduction.\n\n\nConsent and Victim Age\n\n\nFor offenses involving victims under the age of 16, the legislation stipulates that consent is not a valid defense for the offender. Essentially, if someone commits a sexual offense against a minor, they cannot argue that the minor consented to the conduct unless they can prove, with evidence, that they genuinely believed the minor was 16 or older.\n\n\nInterstate and Foreign Conduct\n\n\nIn updating existing laws, any sexual offenses that involve the travel in interstate or foreign commerce will be addressed. This ensures that actions taken across state or international borders are covered under U.S. federal law.\n\n\nIntentional Touching of Minors\n\n\nThere are new prohibitions on causing intentional touching of a minor’s genitalia with the intent to abuse, humiliate, or satisfy sexual desires, even if this touching occurs through clothing. Offenders found guilty of such actions will be subject to fines and imprisonment.\n\n\nAttempts to Commit Offenses\n\n\nThe bill makes clear that individuals who attempt to commit offenses related to sexual contact with minors can be penalized just as severely as if they had completed the offense. This strengthens the enforcement against those who plan or attempt to engage in such misconduct.\n\n\nEffective Date\n\n\nThe changes proposed in the bill will apply to all conduct occurring before, on, or after the enactment date, meaning that it has retroactive applicability to ensure that offenses are prosecuted under the updated, stricter definitions and penalties.\n\n\nConforming Amendments\n\n\nAdditionally, the bill includes several amendments to civil rights offenses involving sexual misconduct by clarifying and updating existing legal language, which may lead to clearer enforcement and increase penalties associated with those offenses.\n\n\nPenalties and Sentencing Adjustments\n\n\nThe legislation updates sentencing classifications for offenders under various sexual misconduct statutes, which may lead to harsher penalties for those convicted. The amendments also refine how certain offenses are categorized, potentially affecting how offenders are prosecuted and sentenced.\n\n\nSummary of Impact\n\n\nOverall, the Strengthening Child Exploitation Enforcement Act aims to bolster legal protections for minors against sexual exploitation and abuse by expanding definitions of offenses and closing legal loopholes. The bill seeks to ensure that offenders are held accountable more effectively under federal law.\n\n\nRelevant Companies\n\n\nNone found\nRepresentative Troy E.

The schedule is as follows:\n\n\n\n$9.50 starting on the effective date\n\n\n$11.00 one year later\n\n\n$12.50 two years later\n\n\n$14.00 three years later\n\n\n$15.50 four years later\n\n\n$17.00 five years later\n\n\n\nAdditionally, after five years, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually based on increases in the median wage for all employees, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\n\nTipped Employees\n\n\n\nMinimum wage for tipped employees would also increase incrementally over six years, reaching $17.00 per hour as well. The scheduled increases are:\n\n\n\n$6.00 starting on the effective date\n\n\n$8.00 one year later\n\n\n$10.00 two years later\n\n\n$12.00 three years later\n\n\n$13.50 four years later\n\n\n$15.00 five years later\n\n\n$17.00 six years later\n\n\n\nThe bill mandates that employees retain all tips received, and employers must inform employees of their rights regarding tips.\n\n\nThe separate minimum wage structure for tipped employees would eventually be repealed, aligning their pay with the standard minimum wage.\n\n\n\nNewly Hired Employees Aged Under 20\n\n\n\nThe bill also addresses wages for newly hired employees who are less than 20 years old. The minimum wage for these employees would similarly be increased, starting at $6.00 and eventually matching the standard minimum wage.\n\n\nThe current provision allowing a lower wage for this demographic would be repealed, ensuring that all employees earn the same minimum wage.\n\n\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities\n\n\n\nFor individuals with disabilities, the bill mandates a transition to fair wages. The minimum wage for these individuals would gradually increase from $5.00 to match the standard minimum wage over the same five-year period.\n\n\nThe bill prohibits the issuance of new special certificates that allow paying less than the minimum wage to individuals with disabilities, thereby promoting equal pay.\n\n\n\nPublication of Wage Adjustments\n\n\n\nThe Secretary of Labor would be required to publish notices about upcoming wage increases, ensuring transparency and public awareness.\n\n\n\nGeneral Effective Date\n\n\n\nThe bill’s provisions would generally take effect three months after its enactment, with specific provisions having their own designated effective dates.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant Companies\n\n\n\n\nMCD\n\n- McDonald's Corporation: As a major employer in the fast-food industry with a significant number of low-wage workers, McDonald's could see an increase in labor costs associated with the rise in minimum wage.\n\n\n\nDCRD\n\n- Darden Restaurants, Inc.: Darden, which operates several casual dining restaurant brands, may face higher labor expenses leading to changes in pricing or business strategies.\n\n\n\nSBUX\n\n- Starbucks Corporation: This company also employs many workers at or around the minimum wage and would need to adjust its salaries accordingly, which may impact its overall cost structure.\n\nRepresentative Robert C. \"Bobby\" Scott Bill Proposals\nHere are some bills which have recently been proposed by Representative Robert C. \"Bobby\" Scott:\nH.R.2743: Raise the Wage Act of 2025\nH.R.1954: Do No Harm Act\nH.R.1581: Fort Monroe National Historical Park Establishment Act\nH.R.20: Richard L.

The key points are:\n\n\n\nIndividuals qualifying for this credit can receive a tax credit of **$10,000** for the tax year in which they donate a kidney, as well as for the following four tax years.\n\n\nA \"qualified non-directed living kidney donation\" is defined as a kidney donation where the donor does not know the identity of the recipient at the time of donation.\n\n\nThe donation must occur while the donor is living and involves the surgical removal of the kidney.\n\n\n\nSpecial Provisions\n\n\nThe bill includes special provisions regarding the tax credit:\n\n\n\nIf the donor dies in a tax year for which the credit is allowed, they can claim a credit of up to **$50,000**, minus any credits claimed in previous years.\n\n\nThe date of donation is established as the date when the kidney is removed from the donor.\n\n\n\nTermination of the Credit\n\n\nThe tax credit for non-directed living kidney donations will not be available after **December 31, 2036**.\n\n\nAdditional Amendments\n\n\nTo implement this new credit, the bill makes several conforming amendments to existing tax laws.

This transfer will include all rights and interests of the U.S. government in relation to the land.\n\n\n\nRetention of Water Rights:\n\nThe Secretary of Energy is to retain specific water rights necessary to fulfill regulatory obligations under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act and other relevant regulations.

However, this does not guarantee the provision of COBRA coverage for individuals who choose to enroll in Medicare.\n\n\n\nUpdating Notifications\n\n\nLastly, the bill mandates that by January 1, 2026, the Secretary of Labor, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, must update notification requirements related to COBRA coverage.

Here’s a summary of its main components:\n\n\nPurpose of the Bill\n\n\nThe main objective of the bill is to secure the rights of public employees to:\n\n\n\nOrganize and form labor unions.\n\n\nBargain collectively with their employers regarding their wages, hours, and other working conditions.\n\n\nEngage in concerted activities aimed at improving their workplace conditions.\n\n\n\nDefinitions and Key Terms\n\n\nThe bill defines key terms essential to understanding its provisions:\n\n\n\n\nPublic Employee:\n\nAn individual employed by a governmental entity engaged in commerce.\n\n\n\nCollective Bargaining:\n\nThe mutual obligation between public employers and their employees to meet and negotiate in good faith on employment terms.\n\n\n\nLabor Organization:\n\nAn organization that represents the interests of public employees in dealings with employers.\n\n\n\nFederal Minimum Standards\n\n\nThe bill requires the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to set specific minimum rights and procedures for collective bargaining. These include:\n\n\n\nThe right for public employees to organize and choose their own representatives.\n\n\nThe obligation for public employers to recognize and negotiate with labor organizations.\n\n\nMethods for resolving disputes such as mediation or arbitration.\n\n\nProvisions for payroll deductions for labor organization fees.\n\n\nProhibitions against practices that intimidate or coerce employees regarding their bargaining rights.\n\n\n\nImplementation and Oversight\n\n\nThe FLRA is mandated to determine the adequacy of state laws regarding the above rights and procedures. If a state is found to lack sufficient provisions, the FLRA will take specified actions to enforce compliance, which may include:\n\n\n\nSetting up voting procedures for employee representation elections.\n\n\nResolving complaints about violations of the act.\n\n\nEnforcing penalties for non-compliance.\n\n\n\nEmergency Services Employees\n\n\nThe bill includes specific provisions for emergency services and law enforcement personnel. It prohibits strikes or lockouts that could disrupt public safety services, while also not overriding state laws related to these employees' striking rights.\n\n\nExisting Agreements and Protections\n\n\nAny existing labor agreements or collective bargaining recognitions that were in effect prior to the enactment of this bill will not be invalidated.

This bill was received on 2025-04-07, and currently has 6 cosponsors.\nHere is a short summary of the bill:\n\nThe Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Act is a piece of legislation aimed at addressing the misidentification of American-Jewish servicemembers buried in U.S. military cemeteries abroad. Here’s a breakdown of the bill's main components:\n\n\nPurpose of the Bill\n\n\nThe bill seeks to ensure that Jewish servicemembers who fought for the United States during World War I and World War II are accurately recognized for their religious heritage. It specifically targets approximately 900 servicemembers who, due to historical inaccuracies, were buried under Latin Crosses rather than appropriate markers reflecting their Jewish heritage.\n\n\nProgram Establishment\n\n\nThe American Battle Monuments Commission is mandated to establish a program specifically called the\n\nFallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Program\n\n. This program will:\n\n\n\nIdentify the named servicemembers buried overseas under incorrect markers.\n\n\nContact the survivors and descendants of these servicemembers to inform them about the misidentification.\n\n\n\nProgram Duration\n\n\nThe program will operate for ten fiscal years following the enactment of the bill. This timeframe allows for thorough identification and rectification of past errors regarding the marking of graves.\n\n\nContracts and Funding\n\n\nTo facilitate the program's objectives, the Commission will:\n\n\n\nEngage in contracts with nonprofit organizations that will assist in carrying out the program.\n\n\nProvide an annual budget of $500,000 for each of the ten fiscal years to support the program's operations.\n\n\nPrefer organizations that have demonstrated the capability and experience in handling similar tasks when awarding contracts.\n\n\n\nFinancial Authorization\n\n\nThe bill authorizes federal appropriations of $500,000 each fiscal year during the program's operation to ensure funding for its activities.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nIn the context of the bill:\n\n\n\nA\n\ncovered member\n\nis defined as a deceased Jewish member of the Armed Forces who was buried in a U.S. military cemetery outside the United States under a marker that does not indicate their Jewish identity.\n\n\nA\n\nnonprofit organization\n\nrefers to an organization described under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, qualifying for tax exemption.\n\n\n\nFindings\n\n\nThe bill outlines findings that support the need for its enactment, including:\n\n\n\nThe historical context where Jewish servicemembers were buried under incorrect markers due to various inadvertent reasons.\n\n\nThe significant role of American-Jewish servicemembers in achieving victories during the World Wars.\n\n\nThe importance of properly recognizing and honoring the heritage of these veterans.\n\n\nThe responsibility of the U.S. Government to rectify previous mistakes in how these servicemembers have been commemorated.\n\n\n\nRelevant Companies\n\n\nNone found\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz Bill Proposals\nHere are some bills which have recently been proposed by Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz:\nH.R.2701: Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Act\nH.R.2657: Sammy’s Law\nH.R.2280: BIRD Energy and U.S.-Israel Energy Center Reauthorization Act of 2025\nH.R.1274: PROTECT Our Children Reauthorization Act of 2025\nH.R.328: REVOCAR Act of 2025\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz Net Worth\nQuiver Quantitative estimates that Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz is worth $486.8K, as of April 18th, 2025.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/natwest-group-nwg-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy","Article":"Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.\nCash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.\nNatWest Group in Focus\nNatWest Group (NWG) is headquartered in London, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 20.65% since the start of the year. The bank is paying out a dividend of $0.38 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 6.21% compared to the Banks - Foreign industry's yield of 4.12% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%.\nTaking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $0.76 is up 72.7% from last year. Over the last 5 years, NatWest Group has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 44.67%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, NatWest's payout ratio is 23%, which means it paid out 23% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.\nLooking at this fiscal year, NWG expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 is $1.46 per share, with earnings expected to increase 9.77% from the year ago period.\nBottom Line\nInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.\nHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that NWG is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/national-grid-ngg-323-one-week-what-you-should-know","Article":"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at National Grid (NGG), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. National Grid currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nIn order to see if NGG is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this electricity and gas utility holds up.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\nFor NGG, shares are up 3.23% over the past week while the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry is up 1.41% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 10.8% compares favorably with the industry's 0.3% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of National Grid have increased 18.78% over the past quarter, and have gained 10.19% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved -11.63% and 6.63%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of NGG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, NGG is averaging 970,738 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with NGG.\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NGG's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.80 to $4.81 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NGG is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nEveryone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nRight now, Pediatrix Medical Group is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while HealthEquity has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that MD has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.\nValue investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nMD currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 8.30, while HQY has a forward P\/E of 23.33. We also note that MD has a PEG ratio of 0.87. This metric is used similarly to the famous P\/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. HQY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.15.\nAnother notable valuation metric for MD is its P\/B ratio of 1.44. The P\/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, HQY has a P\/B of 3.46.\nBased on these metrics and many more, MD holds a Value grade of A, while HQY has a Value grade of D.\nMD is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that MD is likely the superior value option right now.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/marathon-digital-holdings-inc-mara-trending-stock-facts-know-betting-it-5","Article":"Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. (MARA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Technology Services industry, which Marathon Digital falls in, has lost 25.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nMarathon Digital is expected to post a loss of $0.35 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -483.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +14.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of -$1.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -168%. This estimate has changed -17.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.17 indicates a change of +0.1% from what Marathon Digital is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +14%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Digital.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Marathon Digital, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $241.99 million indicates a year-over-year change of +46.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $991.1 million and $1.15 billion estimates indicate +51% and +15.6% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMarathon Digital reported revenues of $214.39 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.8%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with -$0.02 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $190.99 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +12.25%. The EPS surprise was +487.5%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMarathon Digital is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Digital. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren’t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/mac-copper-limited-mtal-upgraded-buy-what-does-it-mean-stock","Article":"MAC Copper Limited (MTAL) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.\nA company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.\nSince a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.\nAs such, the Zacks rating upgrade for MAC Copper Limited is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.\nMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices\nThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.\nFor MAC Copper Limited, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.\nHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions\nAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions for MAC Copper Limited\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2025, this company is expected to earn $0.92 per share, which is a change of 193.9% from the year-ago reported number.\nAnalysts have been steadily raising their estimates for MAC Copper Limited. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7.1%.\nBottom Line\nUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.\nYou can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>\nThe upgrade of MAC Copper Limited to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/looking-stocks-positive-earnings-momentum-check-out-these-2-utilities-names","Article":"Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\nHunting for 'earnings whispers' or companies poised to beat their quarterly earnings estimates is a somewhat common practice. But that doesn't make it easy. One way that has been proven to work is by using the Zacks Earnings ESP tool.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information.\nWith this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure. The system also utilizes our core Zacks Rank to provide a stronger system for identifying stocks that might beat their next quarterly earnings estimate and possibly see the stock price climb.\nWhen we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\nStocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.\nShould You Consider NextEra Energy?\nNow that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. NextEra Energy (NEE) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.99 a share, just five days from its upcoming earnings release on April 23, 2025.\nNEE has an Earnings ESP figure of +2.33%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.99 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.97. NextEra Energy is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nNEE is just one of a large group of Utilities stocks with a positive ESP figure. American Electric Power (AEP) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.\nSlated to report earnings on May 6, 2025, American Electric Power holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.05 a share 18 days from its next quarterly update.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric Power is $1.88, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +9.22%.\nNEE and AEP's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(HAYW) and Rockwell Automation (ROK). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.\nHayward Holdings, Inc. and Rockwell Automation are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that HAYW likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ROK has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.\nValue investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nOur Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P\/E ratio, the P\/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.\nHAYW currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 16.50, while ROK has a forward P\/E of 25.23. We also note that HAYW has a PEG ratio of 1.93. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P\/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ROK currently has a PEG ratio of 2.92.\nAnother notable valuation metric for HAYW is its P\/B ratio of 1.82. Investors use the P\/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ROK has a P\/B of 7.39.\nThese metrics, and several others, help HAYW earn a Value grade of B, while ROK has been given a Value grade of D.\nHAYW is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\nAgnico Eagle Mines is a member of the Basic Materials sector. This group includes 232 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #11. The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.\nThe Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions. The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months. Agnico Eagle Mines is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEM's full-year earnings has moved 9.6% higher within the past quarter. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.\nBased on the latest available data, AEM has gained about 55.4% so far this year. At the same time, Basic Materials stocks have gained an average of 1.8%. This means that Agnico Eagle Mines is outperforming the sector as a whole this year.\nOne other Basic Materials stock that has outperformed the sector so far this year is Salzgitter AG (SZGPY).

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/griffon-gff-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-think-yes","Article":"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nGriffon (GFF) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this garage door and building products maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Griffon is 37.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.4%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Griffon is 0.6%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -16.8%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.3%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Griffon have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nGriffon has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Griffon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/grant-cardone-heres-how-wealthy-people-invest-their-money-retirement","Article":"Planning for retirement is one of the most crucial aspects of financial planning. For many Americans, this involves setting savings targets for their 401(k) plans or IRAs. However, according to Grant Cardone, author of “The 10X Rule,” the wealthy take a different approach.\nRead Next: 3 Signs You’ve ‘Made It’ Financially, According to Financial Influencer Genesis Hinckley\nFor You: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n“If you study wealthy people, they are not focused on 401(k) [plans] and IRAs,” he told GOBankingRates. “People have gotten wealthy selling 401(k) plans and IRAs — Vanguard and Fidelity have made a lot of money managing people’s retirement [savings].”\nIf you want to invest for retirement like the wealthy, here’s how Cardone says to do it.\nTake Cues From the Financial Institutions\nCardone said that instead of giving your money to firms like Vanguard and Fidelity, you should follow what they do with their funds.\n“Do what those groups do with the money that you give them — what they’re doing is they’re investing in insurance products, companies that produce passive income and they’re heavily invested in real estate that produces income,” he said.\nTrending Now: Are You Rich or Middle Class? 8 Ways To Tell That Go Beyond Your Paycheck\nInvest the Bulk of Your Funds in Income-Producing Real Estate\nCardone believes that investing in income-producing real estate now is the best way to ensure you are financially secure in retirement.\n“When you hit retirement, you do not need a lump sum in an IRA or 401(k),” he said. “What you need when you retire at 65 or 68 years old is income to take care of your expenses. I would look for vehicles that, when you retire, are going to pay you money every month.”\nCardone has taken his own advice. He explains why he decided on real estate as the best investment for the long haul: “When I was 30 years old, I started looking for the asset class where I couldn’t lose money,” he said. “That means I can’t just save money because money is going down in value. I can’t be in the stock market because I could lose money.\n“No. 2, I need passive income from my investment,” he said. “No. 3, I want some appreciation in the asset over long periods of time. And No. 4, I’d like to get some tax write-offs because taxes are everybody’s biggest expense, no matter what income bracket you’re in. So what fits those four criteria? There’s only one asset class that does all that. It’s not gold, silver, Bitcoin or the stock market — it’s real estate.”\nCardone said that he keeps 95% of his wealth invested in real estate.\n“Even when it comes down in value — like right now, all valuations are coming down — my income from the real estate doesn’t go down,” he said. “The value can come down but the income is still taking care of me. And I’m not selling today anyway, so that’s fine.”\nAs Cardone notes, rent prices have always increased over time, so your income from owning these assets should increase as well.\n“If you look back at rents in 1940 in this country, they were $27 a month. This year, the median rent in America is $2,000,” he said. “And that will continue to happen. In the next seven years, I predict the median rent in America will be $3,000, which means there will be tremendous amounts of wealth created in rental properties.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nMark Cuban: Trump's Tariffs Will Affect This Class of People the Most\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nHow To Get the Most Value From Your Costco Membership in 2025\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Grant Cardone: Here’s How Wealthy People Invest Their Money for Retirement\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/gladstone-commercial-corporation-good-attracting-investor-attention-here-what-you-should","Article":"Gladstone Commercial (GOOD) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this real estate investment trust have returned -4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, to which Gladstone Commercial belongs, has lost 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Gladstone Commercial is expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share, indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.43 points to a change of +0.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.47 indicates a change of +3.3% from what Gladstone Commercial is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Gladstone Commercial.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Gladstone Commercial, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $37.15 million indicates a year-over-year change of +4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $152.52 million and $156.92 million estimates indicate +2.1% and +2.9% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nGladstone Commercial reported revenues of $37.38 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.1%. EPS of $0.09 for the same period compares with $0.03 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.45 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.2%. The EPS surprise was 0%.\nOver the last four quarters, Gladstone Commercial surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nGladstone Commercial is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Gladstone Commercial. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/giii-apparel-group-giii-stock-undervalued-right-now-2","Article":"The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.\nConsidering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.\nZacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.\nOne stock to keep an eye on is GIII Apparel Group (GIII). GIII is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P\/E ratio of 5.58 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P\/E of 9.68. Over the past year, GIII's Forward P\/E has been as high as 8.76 and as low as 5.33, with a median of 7.41.\nValue investors also frequently use the P\/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. GIII has a P\/S ratio of 0.33. This compares to its industry's average P\/S of 0.44.\nValue investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that GIII Apparel Group is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, GIII sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -23.4% due to these changes.\nVGM Scores\nAt this time, General Mills has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\nOutlook\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

(KNSL) will report quarterly earnings of $3.15 per share in its upcoming release, pointing to a year-over-year decline of 10%. It is anticipated that revenues will amount to $424.32 million, exhibiting an increase of 13.8% compared to the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This reflects how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reevaluated their initial estimates during this timeframe.\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Kinsale Capital Group metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Revenues- Net investment income' stands at $43.84 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +33.1%.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenues- Net Earned Premiums' will reach $370.83 million. The estimate indicates a change of +5.6% from the prior-year quarter.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenues- Fee Income' will reach $9.37 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +15.8%.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Expense Ratio' will likely reach 21.0%. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 20.7% in the same quarter last year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Combined Ratio' reaching 86.9%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 79.5%.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Loss Ratio' at 65.9%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 58.8%.\n\nView all Key Company Metrics for Kinsale Capital Group here>>>\n\nShares of Kinsale Capital Group have demonstrated returns of +5.8% over the past month compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/gap-stock-pros-and-cons-buying-dip-amid-trump-tariff-drama","Article":"In the wake of the President Donald Trump’s announcement of “Liberation Day” tariffs, the stock market tumbled. And that included Gap Inc. (GAP) and stocks of other retail companies that rely heavily on overseas manufacturing.\nBe Aware: Trump Isn’t Ruling Out a Recession This Year — What Could That Mean for Your Wallet?\nFind Out: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nInvestors who are considering taking advantage of this decline may well be wondering whether now is the right time to “buy the dip” in the stock or whether caution should prevail in light of the ongoing tariff battle.\nThe Impact of Trump’s Tariffs on Gap\nThe reciprocal tariffs sent shockwaves through U.S. retail stocks, though the Trump administration has since announced a pause on most reciprocal tariffs. Still, companies like Gap, which depend on international manufacturing, are feeling the effects.\nFor Gap, which manufactures a significant portion of its apparel in countries like China, Vietnam and Bangladesh, the immediate impact of the new tariffs was a sharp decline in its stock price. As of April 17, Gap stock is down almost 23% for the year.\nRead Next: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Bought Over $73 Million in Shares of This Tech Company — Here’s Why\nHistorical Context and Current Sentiment\nTo assess whether buying the dip in Gap stock is a sound decision, it’s essential to look at both historical performance and the current economic climate. Over the years, Gap has weathered numerous challenges, from changing consumer preferences to fluctuations in global trade policies.\nIn past instances of market turbulence, Gap’s stock has typically rebounded after initial declines. This historical pattern could indicate that the company could once again recover from the current downturn.\nHowever, the sentiment surrounding Gap’s future is may be more mixed this time around. While Gap’s brand strength and global presence could help it navigate through these turbulent waters, the current geopolitical uncertainty adds a layer of risk. The tariffs, which target a wide array of goods, could have a longer-lasting impact on the company’s profit margins. Additionally, consumer demand for affordable clothing may be affected if prices rise as a result of the tariffs.\nDespite these risks, some experts maintain that Gap is well positioned to adapt. The company has made efforts in recent years to streamline its operations and diversify its supplier base. In fact, according to Fortune, Gap CEO Richard Dickson recently spoke at the Shoptalk retail industry conference. “Big credit goes to our supply chains. We’ve been working on diversifying our manufacturer footprint for quite some time. Less than 10% of our product is coming out of China,” he said.\nThese moves may help Gap, but the tariffs affect other countries too.\nIs ‘Buying the Dip’ the Right Move?\nSome investors may see the recent drop in price as an opportunity to acquire shares at a bargain, particularly for those with a long-term investment strategy. The rationale here is that, like other retail giants, Gap has a history of bouncing back after periods of decline. For those who believe the stock market will recover and that Gap’s operational adjustments will eventually pay off, now might be the time to buy.\nBut for those considering a short-term investment, the risk of further declines may outweigh the potential rewards. If tariffs continue to escalate, or if consumer sentiment falters, Gap’s stock could take additional hits before it stabilizes. As such, some may recommend waiting until the effects of the tariffs are fully understood before making a move.\n“There’s a lot of risk involved in buying Gap stock right now. There is certainly the possibility that the stock will rebound and investors will see pleasing returns. However, with so much financial uncertainty, consumers buy necessities, not clothes that may or may not have a rebounding cool factor. So, if Gap stock rebounds, it’s probably going to lag behind other stocks that are currently trending lower,” said Melanie Musson, a finance expert with Clearsurance.\nDue to the continuing market volatility, it may be better to wait. “Since so many stocks are experiencing a dip, there are better options. Skip Gap and try for a different dip that has a higher probability of rebounding,” she said.\nWeighing the Risks and Rewards of Buying Gap Stock\nThe recent drop in Gap’s stock price has sparked renewed debate about whether now is the right time to “buy the dip.” While some may see it as an opportunity to acquire shares at a discounted price, others urge caution, pointing to the uncertainties created by the tariffs and their potential long-term effects on Gap’s business.\nUltimately, the decision to buy or hold should be based on individual investment goals, risk tolerance and the willingness to weather potential market fluctuations. \nMore From GOBankingRates\nMark Cuban: Trump's Tariffs Will Affect This Class of People the Most\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nHow To Get the Most Value From Your Costco Membership in 2025\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Gap Stock: Pros and Cons of ‘Buying the Dip’ Amid Trump Tariff Drama\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

If these efforts are successful, it could mean you’ll pay less money to Uncle Sam.\nLearn More: 2 Ways Elon Musk’s Access to the US Treasury May Impact Social Security\nFind Out: How To Turn Your Tax Refund Into an Extra $1K This Year\nDOGE Plans\nSince its inception, DOGE has saved $931.68 per taxpayer — a total of $150 billion — according to the agency’s website, as of April 11. This includes approximately $25 billion in contract terminations, around $33 billion in grant terminations and roughly $400 million in lease terminations.\nIn a March 2025 interview with Fox Business Network’s “Kudlow,” Musk said he hopes to find $1 trillion in savings. This number was reduced from an initial goal of achieving $2 trillion in savings.\nRead Next: Trump Wants To Replace Income Taxes With Tariffs: 2 Impacts on the Middle Class\nImpact on Your Taxes\nThe more DOGE is able to save, the more it could benefit your bank account. In February 2025, President Donald Trump said his team is considering giving Americans a $5,000 check with the savings — which would equate to 20% of expected DOGE savings — and using another 20% to pay down the national debt.\nDOGE is cutting costs at rapid pace, but federal government spending has increased $355 million since last fiscal year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. For the fiscal year-to-date, spending is at just over $3 trillion, compared with $2.68 trillion during the same time period — October 2023 through February 2024 — last year.\nNoah Damsky, CFA, principal at Marina Wealth Advisors in Los Angeles, highlighted two ways DOGE can save money for taxpayers: deregulation and increased efficiency.\n“Firing swaths of government employees means fewer employees and leaner government entities, which is a backdoor to deregulation,” he said. “Smaller teams mean less regulation and will spur risk-taking and economic activity.”\nDeregulation\nDeregulation could have a positive impact, but he said there could also be drawbacks.\n“Unfortunately, this likely means more illegitimate activity, as well,” he said. “However, deregulation broadly should spur more activity overall, which can boost GDP over time and result in higher tax revenue.”\nEfficiency\nAs for increased efficiency, Damsky said smaller government teams will need to become more productive if they want to try to achieve the same level of output with fewer employees.\n“As someone who worked in local government, I think we could have fired half the team and been just as efficient over time,” he said. “I anticipate this may be a similar perspective at other levels of government.”\nWhile DOGE cuts are new and workers are still getting adjusted, Damsky is optimistic that agencies will be able to properly function with fewer staffers.\n“Hopefully, government agencies adjust to fewer employees by increasing production and saving taxpayers money,” he said.\nUltimately, the total amount of money DOGE could save taxpayers remains to be seen. Since the agency has only been around for a few months, time will tell if it ends up saving taxpayers’ money or costing you in more ways than one.\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/heres-why-amgen-amgn-strong-value-stock-1","Article":"Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.\nThe popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\nEach stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nFor value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\nVGM Score\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\nInvestors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nBut it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nTo have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: Amgen (AMGN)\nThousand Oaks, CA-based Amgen is one of the biggest biotech companies in the world, with a strong presence in the oncology\/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health and rare diseases markets. The company used advances in cellular and molecular biology to develop two of the biotech industry’s earliest and most successful drugs, Epogen (anemia) and Neupogen (white blood cell stimulant). Amgen successfully launched two next-generation products, Aranesp and Neulasta.  Meanwhile, the acquisition of Immunex Corporation gave Amgen access to the multi-blockbuster drug, Enbrel. However, all these older drugs are facing declining sales due to biosimilar or branded competition, which is being somewhat offset by its blockbuster growth drugs like Prolia and Xgeva.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/here-why-growth-investors-should-buy-universal-technical-uti-now","Article":"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nOur proprietary system currently recommends Universal Technical Institute (UTI) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this school for auto, motorcycle and marine technicians is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Universal Technical is 43.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 34% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 23.8%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Universal Technical is 60.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 3.2%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 63.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.4%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Universal Technical. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nUniversal Technical has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Universal Technical well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/incredibly-cheap-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-terrific-bargain-right-now","Article":"Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is having a woeful April as shares of the memory specialist have dropped 20% so far this month, and the tariff-fueled turmoil has a lot to do with the stock's recent pullback. Reports suggest that Micron could increase the prices of its memory products amid the ongoing tariff war. That's because Micron has a global manufacturing footprint, including factories in the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, and China.\nHowever, semiconductors have been exempted from tariffs by both the U.S. and China (at least so far). Additionally, the Trump administration has put a 90-day pause on imposing reciprocal tariffs on most of its trade partners who would have otherwise been subjected to higher tariff rates. Also, the administration has exempted imports of memory chips and hard drives from China.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\nAs such, Micron may not need to raise the prices of its offerings, a move that may have hurt the demand since its customers would have had to contend with increased costs. What's more, Micron's memory products are witnessing such strong demand that the company is finding it difficult to produce enough of them. This was evident from the company's impressive numbers in the previous quarter, as well as its bright outlook for the current one.\nLet's take a closer look at the reasons why buying Micron stock following its latest pullback seems like a smart thing to do.\nMicron is too cheap to ignore right now\nFor a company that delivered a 38% year-over-year increase in revenue in the previous quarter, along with a 3.7x jump in earnings, Micron's valuation makes it worth buying hand over fist right away. The company is trading at less than 17 times trailing earnings. Its forward earnings multiple of 10 is even cheaper.\nThe tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index, meanwhile, has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 27 and forward earnings multiple of 23. Micron, therefore, is significantly cheaper right now, considering the phenomenal growth that it has been delivering in recent quarters.\nMU Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\nEven better, Micron is incredibly cheap when we take its potential earnings growth into account. The stock has a price\/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.15 based on the projected earnings growth it could deliver over the next five years, according to Yahoo! Finance. The PEG ratio is calculated by taking a company's future earnings growth potential into account, and a reading of less than 1 indicates that a stock is undervalued.\nSo, Micron's PEG ratio suggests that it is very cheap, considering the expected growth it could clock over the next five years, driven by the deployment of AI infrastructure and devices capable of running AI workloads.\nAI proliferation is set to drive healthy growth in memory demand\nMicron is benefiting from the fast-growing demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in graphics processing units (GPUs) to run artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in data centers. The company's data center revenue tripled year over year, with HBM alone accounting for a record $1 billion in quarterly revenue.\nMicron says that its HBM shipments exceeded expectations. What's more, the company has sold its entire HBM capacity for 2025, and it is currently \"focused on growing HBM capacity in our existing manufacturing facilities to meet requirements through 2026.\" Another factor worth noting here is that Micron has raised its total addressable market (TAM) estimate for HBM to $35 billion for 2025.\nThat figure is likely to head higher in the long run, with one third-party estimate putting the size of the HBM market at almost $86 billion in 2030. So, Micron's data center business still has a lot of room for growth in the long run on the back of solid HBM demand. But this isn't where the company's AI-related catalysts end.\nMicron's memory products are also used in smartphones and personal computers (PCs). The usage of memory in both these applications is rising thanks to AI. Specifically, Micron says that the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) content in AI-enabled PCs is a third more than the average content used in PCs last year. Meanwhile, flagship AI smartphones are using 50% more DRAM than the 8 gigabytes (GB) of DRAM seen in 2024 models.\nIt is worth noting that the shipments of both AI-capable smartphones and PCs are expected to jump at an annual pace of almost 35% through 2029. This could pave the way for stronger growth in Micron's memory shipments in the long run, complementing the healthy growth in the company's data center business.\nAs such, Micron Technology's prospects seem robust, and the semiconductor stock's valuation means that investors can buy it at very attractive levels right now, and they may not want to miss this opportunity since the company's outstanding growth could help it overcome its recent slump and fly higher in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/im-millennial-4-ways-im-cutting-back-during-tariff-uncertainty","Article":"With prices rising unpredictably due to shifting tariffs and trade tensions, many millennial workers are tightening their budgets as they feel the pinch. \nRead Next: Trump’s Economy: Why Millennials Love It and Boomers Don’t\nFind Out: 7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nIn this uncertain economic climate, one millennial shared the real-life adjustments she and her husband are making to stay financially afloat, from cutting nonessentials to finding smarter ways to stretch every dollar. \nHere’s how they’re cutting back and responding to a time of economic uncertainty.\nReplacing What Could Be Affected\nWhile some people have been surprised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Ana M., age 34, a content marketer and ghostwriter based in Connecticut, said, “As soon as Trump was elected, we knew that tariffs were coming.” \nAs a result, she said she and her husband took stock of everything that they’d need to replace soon that would likely be impacted and preemptively replaced them, including the battery in her husband’s car, which was on its last legs, and her phone, which has a broken speaker.\nAside from that, they began cutting down on spending immediately, even before Trump was in office knowing that tariffs would be coming and “potentially a contributing factor to a recession,” she said.  \nLearn More: 4 Mistakes the Upper Middle Class Are Making With Their Money in the Trump Economy\nChoosing Where To Cut Back\nAna and her husband are “very concerned” about a possible recession and so are prioritizing liquid savings for the time being. \n“My job is particularly high risk and has already been impacted by multiple economic conditions, so we want to prepare for that,” she said. They’re making strategic cuts where they can, such as reducing a live TV Hulu subscription ($120 per month) to a basic plan that is just $29 per month. \n“We’ve also stopped pretty much all nonessential spending and splurge purchases, outside of local experiences. Instead of getting gifts this year for our birthdays, we went to a hockey game,” she said. \nThey’ve also begun to feel the pinch of increased prices on many of the items they consider “essentials” such as home goods and cleaning supplies. While they are continuing to buy the products they prefer, even at higher prices, they have put off some larger purchases such as gutter guards and a home generator, which were impacted by tariffs.\nA Longer Mortgage Timeline\nAnother casualty of this time of high-tariff uncertainty is that it’s drawing out the timeline in which she and her husband were originally going to pay off their mortgage. Instead of making extra big payments to speed that process along in 15 years, now, she said, “We’re holding onto those funds so we have extra cash on hand in case my business struggles in the near future.”\nA Change in Investments\nThe tariffs are also changing how they invest. They’re putting more money into accounts that they have easy access to, including high-yield savings, CDs and Roth retirement accounts, instead of the SEP IRA she typically uses. \n“I’m taking a hands off approach for the time being, as I’ve got the majority of my portfolio currently in relatively ‘safe’ funds like the S&P 500,” she said.\nShe’s seen a significant drop in her portfolio value, but since she has a long way to retirement, her strategy is to leave it be and let it recover. \nThe Millennial Mindset\nAna feels that her unique experience as a millennial has helped her prepare for bumpy economic times. She started college during the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and graduated in 2012 to find that many local businesses in her area had shuttered. After struggling to find a good job, she started her own business. \nThough that experience taught her to be more “risk averse,” a skill she and her husband also used during the COVID-19 pandemic, she feels more uncertain now about the economy than she ever has. \n“The tariffs and other economic conditions are more concerning to me this time around, because they feel much more man-made and it does not feel like we have a good faith effort from the administration to resolve the issues.” \nShe’s concerned that tariffs and their economic impact will be dragged out for an extended period of time. \nAdvice to Other Millennials\nAna believes that the best thing millennials can do right now is prepare for increased costs and potential difficulties with unemployment. \n“That emergency fund is never more important than when you may struggle to get a new job if you lose your current one, and as prices are increasing from tariffs and inflation, I think it’s smart to have more saved than you might think you need.” \nLike many people, Ana and her husband are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Types of Vehicles Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m a Millennial: 4 Ways I’m Cutting Back During Tariff Uncertainty\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}

Since then, though, EV sales growth has slowed notably, and some of the top names in the industry are attracting more controversy than investor interest.\nReflecting this, next-generation battery maker QuantumScape's (NYSE: QS) popularity has faded like a sputtering electrical charge.

That's a sharp deceleration of nearly 90%.\nIf investors were bailing from the EV industry as a whole, you can bet they were speeding far away from a company that is still in the development stage with its technology and doesn't produce revenue.\nYet QuantumScape has quite the compelling product making its way through the development process. Its goal is to bring to market a solid-state EV battery that offers far more range on a full charge, and recharges much quickly, than the currently standard lithium-ion products.\nQuantumScape's tech is also rugged; recent testing indicated that when charged, its battery cells managed to fill to over 95% capacity after more than 1,000 charging cycles.\nCharged with potential\nMeanwhile, QuantumScape has a muscular financial backer -- Volkswagen, a key investor that's plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into the company.\nUnder agreements between the two, Volkswagen's battery unit will license QuantumScape's technology to power the automaker's EVs once it exits the development stage. It's estimated that the latter's batteries could power as many as one million new Volkswagen vehicles annually.\nIt's nerve-rattling to invest in a pre-revenue company that hasn't proven it can sell product. Yet QuantumScape's technology appears to be extremely promising, and with a deep-pocketed partner it likely won't be going under anytime soon (if at all). QuantumScape stock is a risky investment for even the hardiest market players, but I think it's got a good chance to fly.

Huron Consulting (HURN) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\nHuron Consulting is a member of our Business Services group, which includes 272 different companies and currently sits at #7 in the Zacks Sector Rank.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/how-protect-your-ira-stock-market-crash","Article":"Investing in the stock market is an excellent way to generate long-term growth in your retirement portfolio. But to participate in the upside, you’ll have to endure the volatility that goes hand-in-hand with the stock market.\nLearn More: How To Protect Your 401(k) From a Stock Market Crash\nTry This: 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nWhile the U.S. stock market returns an average of 10% per year over the long run, it regularly experiences drops of 10%, 20% or even more. In your 20s and 30s, you have the time to ride these drops out, but if you’re approaching retirement, they could cause bigger problems.\nHere’s a look at how to protect your IRA from a stock market crash and how your strategy should change as retirement approaches.\nDiversify\nOne of the best ways to protect your assets from a stock market crash is to diversify. Diversification means owning different investments that don’t move in tandem, so that when some of your assets are down in value, others are rising. This can even out the ups and downs that come with a volatile, 100%-stock portfolio.\nFor a truly diversified portfolio, you should blend a combination of non-correlated assets. If your portfolio is dominated by large-cap tech stocks, like Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, you should add small- and mid-cap stocks in different sectors, such as healthcare, financials or utilities. If your portfolio is entirely built around U.S. stocks, consider adding foreign stocks, as well.\nBeyond the stock world, you can truly add diversification by including other asset classes, such as bonds or precious metals. Overall, you want to build a portfolio that spreads your risk among different types of assets while still meeting your investment objectives.\nBe Aware: Avoid This Retirement Savings Mistake That’s Costing Americans Up To $300K\nKeep Some Dry Powder\nMost experts recommend keeping at least a portion of your portfolio in cash or other liquid investments, like short-term Treasuries. This ensures you’ll have reserves that will prove invaluable when the market trades down, allowing you to scoop up shares at bargain levels.\nYou don’t necessarily need to keep this “dry powder” in your actual IRA account, however. As long as you haven’t already exceeded your IRA’s annual contribution limit, keeping that money in a high-yield savings account, for example, gives you the cash reserves you’ll need to put in your IRA when stocks trade down.\nEvaluate Your Risk\nMany investors aren’t even aware of how much risk they’re taking in their portfolio. If the Magnificent 7 stocks are all that you’ve owned for the last few years, for example, you likely feel pretty good with yourself, as those stocks have all skyrocketed to some degree.\nBut in the stock market, high reward equates to high risk. Stocks that rise by 50% or 100% in a single year may still prove to be great long-term investments, but you shouldn’t be surprised to see them sell off by 25%, 50% or even more at some point.\nIf you’re about to retire and all of your stocks are these high-flyers, you’re very exposed to a potential stock market crash. Evaluate how much risk you can really handle, and adjust your portfolio appropriately. If your portfolio is tech-heavy and crashes 50% right when you begin retirement, you’ll be off to a rough start that could impact your quality of life for decades to come.\nRebalance\nYou can help reduce the risk in your IRA by rebalancing your portfolio regularly. Ideally, when you initially built your portfolio, you set up a diversified account in line with your investment objectives and risk tolerance. When one segment of your portfolio outperforms over a period of time, it will no longer be in line with your pre-planned investment strategy. This typically introduces excess risk into your account.\nAs a simple example, imagine that you constructed a portfolio that allocated 30% of your assets to large-cap tech stocks, 30% to an S&P 500 index fund and 40% to bonds. Over the last few years, it’s likely that those percentages would now look something like 40% in tech stocks, 35% in the S&P 500 and just 25% in bonds. This leaves you overexposed to a market crash.\nBy rebalancing now, back to your original strategy, you’ll be better protected.\nNote that an asset allocation should never be a “one-and-done” strategy.

Not everyone sticks with the same bank for the long haul. Some people stay longer than they probably should, while others might not stay long enough.\nExplore More: 3 Signs You’ve ‘Made It’ Financially, According to Financial Influencer Genesis Hinckley\nTry This: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nSo, how long should you stick with your current bank or credit union? And how often should you switch? Here’s what the experts say.\nSwitch When Your Bank Doesn’t Meet Your Needs\nIf you’re satisfied with your current financial institution, stick with it. But if you’re not, that’s probably a sign it’s time for a change.\n“There are real differences in financial institutions and the personal finance options they offer,” said Tansley Stearns, president and CEO of Community Financial Credit Union and leader of the Backbone Coalition. “When your current bank isn’t meeting your needs or matching your values, it’s time to switch — and it’s easier than you think.”\nTake the time to evaluate what you need from your bank and ask yourself: Am I getting it? If the answer is no, start considering other options.\nBe Aware: If You’re Thinking About Getting a CD, Suze Orman Says You Should Do It Now — Here’s Why\nSigns Your Bank Isn’t Right for You\nThere are so many signs that your financial institution is no longer the best option — for you. According to Susan Espinosa, vice president of Member Experience at Skyla Federal Credit Union, here are some of the big ones:\nYou’re feeling stuck or limited with your financial institution or its offerings.\nYou feel pressured into accepting financial products you don’t want or need.\nYou feel pressured into opening a new credit card or adding on extra services.\nYour bank isn’t helping you meet your financial goals.\nThe service is consistently bad or you feel like “just another number with no real personalized attention.”\nOther financial institutions offer better interest rates (for credit cards and savings accounts).\n“Many folks decide to leave their bank just because they don’t feel valued or supported anymore, and that’s something to seriously think about when evaluating where you keep your money,” said Espinosa.\nWhat to Look For in a New Bank\nIf you’re ready to switch banks, you’ll want to find one that meets your needs — and ideally gives you a better overall feeling and experience than your current one. Don’t choose the first institution you find. Do a little research.\n“You should look for a bank or credit union that genuinely cares about your financial health rather than just their own bottom line,” said Espinosa.\nAlong with this, look for a bank or credit union with:\nTransparency\nGood tech\nMinimal fees\nDeposit insurance\nFinancial solutions that help you meet your goals\n“When deciding your financial home base, I encourage people to find a partner that will do more than handle daily transactions,” added Stearns. “People deserve a financial best friend that stands with you in the joyful and darker times. In that pursuit, I emphasize the big four: purpose, value, service, and convenience.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nMark Cuban: Trump's Tariffs Will Affect This Class of People the Most\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nHow To Get the Most Value From Your Costco Membership in 2025\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Often Should You Really Switch Banks?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/how-maximize-your-retirement-portfolio-these-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-60","Article":"Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.\nAlso, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.\nYour parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.\nFor example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.\nThat means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.\nToday's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.\nUnfortunately, it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income - bonds and Social Security - may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees. But what if there was another option that could provide a steady, reliable source of income in retirement?\nInvest in Dividend Stocks\nAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.\nLook for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.\nOne approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3% and positive average annual dividend growth. Numerous stocks hike dividends over time, counterbalancing inflation risks.\nHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.\nAhold NV (ADRNY)\nis currently shelling out a dividend of $0.61 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.08%. This compares to the Consumer Products - Staples industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.69%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.29%. Check Ahold NV dividend history here>>>\nCommunity Financial System (CBU)\nis paying out a dividend of $0.46 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.45% compared to the Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry's yield of 0% and the S&P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.22% over the past year. Check Community Financial System dividend history here>>>\nCurrently paying a dividend of $0.17 per share,\nCivista Bancshares (CIVB)\nhas a dividend yield of 3.42%. This is compared to the Banks - Midwest industry's yield of 2.92% and the S&P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 6.25%. Check Civista Bancshares dividend history here>>>\nBut aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?\nYes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.\nA silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.\nThinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.\nYou may be thinking, \"I like this dividend strategy, but instead of investing in individual stocks, I'm going to find a dividend-focused mutual fund or ETF.\" This approach can make sense, but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees, which may reduce your dividend gains or income, and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach. If you do wish to invest in a fund, do your research to find the best-quality dividend funds with the lowest fees.\nBottom Line\nPursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/how-find-strong-construction-stocks-slated-positive-earnings-surprises-7","Article":"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.\nWe know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.\nThe ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.\nThe core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction. The Zacks Rank is also factored into the ESP metric to better help find companies that appear poised to top their next bottom-line consensus estimate, which will hopefully help lift the stock price.\nWhen we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.\nStocks with a #3 (Hold) ranking, which is most stocks covered at 60%, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. But stocks that fall into the #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market. Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.\nShould You Consider Dream Finders Homes Inc.\nThe last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to quickly look at a qualifying stock. Dream Finders Homes Inc. (DFH) holds a #2 (Buy) at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.72 a share 13 days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 1, 2025.\nBy taking the percentage difference between the $0.72 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.61 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Dream Finders Homes Inc. has an Earnings ESP of +19.01%. Investors should also know that DFH is one of a large group of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nDFH is one of just a large database of Construction stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Martin Marietta (MLM).\nSlated to report earnings on April 29, 2025, Martin Marietta holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.92 a share 11 days from its next quarterly update.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Martin Marietta is $1.84, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of +4.48%.\nDFH and MLM's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.\nFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're Reported\nUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading. Check it out here >>\nShould You Invest in Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH)?\nBefore you invest in Dream Finders Homes, Inc. (DFH), want to know the best stocks to buy for the next 30 days?

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/how-allocate-parts-your-paycheck-intermittent-luxury-splurges","Article":"Saving money is great, but every now and then, you just need that fancy dinner, weekend getaway or limited-edition gadget. But with recession fears rocking the stock market, as reported by CNN, it can be hard to think of indulging. The good news? You can absolutely treat yourself without blowing your budget. It all comes down to planning.\nFor You: 8 Luxury Items at Costco That You Can Buy for Less\nTry This: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\nHere are some ways to carve out a piece of your paycheck for those well-deserved luxury splurges — guilt-free.\nHow To Budget for Intermittent Luxury Spending\nLuxury splurges don’t have to derail your financial goals — as long as you plan for them. The key is to treat luxury like any other budget category.\nFor example, set aside a small percentage of your paycheck — say, 5% to 10% — into a separate “luxury” or “treat yourself” fund. This way, when something special catches your eye or you’re in the mood for a little indulgence, you’ve already got the cash set aside.\nSee Next: 8 Luxury Gifts To Buy at Sam’s Club in April — for a Loved One or Yourself\n“I’ve found the sweet spot is setting aside 5% to 10% of each paycheck specifically for luxury splurges,” said Andrew Lokenauth, money expert and owner of BeFluentInFinance. “The thing is, you’ve gotta be disciplined about it.”\nHe keeps a separate savings account called his “treat yourself fund” and automatically transfers $200 from each paycheck right when it hits. This way the money’s already earmarked for something special and he doesn’t feel guilty when he eventually spends it.\n“Last December, I saved up enough for a weekend at this amazing resort in Sedona,” he added.\nLokenauth said the satisfaction of paying cash (instead of racking up credit card debt) made those infinity pool views even sweeter. And because he’d planned for it, there wasn’t that usual post-splurge anxiety.\nIt’s all about balance: enjoy the finer things, without sacrificing your financial peace of mind.\nMaking It Work Within Your Overall Financial Picture\nHere’s the critical part — intermittent luxury only works if your basic financial house is in order first. Luxury spending should never come at the expense of your essentials or long-term goals.\nBefore setting aside money for splurges, make sure your financial basics are covered: bills, savings, debt payments and emergency fund contributions. Once those are in place, you can figure out what’s left for the fun stuff.\nLokenauth makes sure his emergency fund has six months of expenses, his 401(k) contribution is at least 15% and he’s got no credit card debt.\n“Then and only then do I give myself permission to save for the fun stuff,” he explained.\nHe said sometimes he’ll boost his luxury savings by picking up extra projects at work or selling stuff he doesn’t need anymore.\nThe extra hustle makes the eventual reward feel even better.\nAnticipating and planning for these occasional splurges helps him stay motivated during long stretches of being disciplined with his money.\nCreating Your Intermittent Luxury Strategy\nStart by deciding what “luxury” means to you. It could be quarterly spa days, designer sneakers, gourmet dining or tech upgrades. Whatever it is, define your splurge goals so you know what you’re saving for.\nNext, figure out your timeline. Are you aiming for a treat every month? Every quarter? Set a realistic frequency based on your income and other financial obligations.\nBased on Lokenauth’s experience helping others with their finances, he said the best approach is starting small.\nHe recommended beginning with setting aside 3% of your income and gradually increasing it as your salary grows. He’s seen too many people try to go too big too fast and end up frustrated.\nThe key is being super specific about what counts as a luxury splurge. For Lokenauth, anything over $500 that isn’t a necessity goes into this category.\nHaving that clear definition keeps him from using his luxury fund for random impulse purchases.\n“Trust me, I learned that lesson the hard way,” Lokenauth said.\nMaking It Sustainable Long-Term\nThe key to luxury spending that doesn’t throw your finances off track? Consistency and self-awareness.\nBuilding a sustainable strategy means checking in with your habits every so often. Are you still hitting your savings goals? Are your splurges still bringing you joy — or just becoming routine?\nOne thing that’s worked well for Lokenauth, is tracking how these occasional luxuries impact his overall happiness compared to regular small indulgences.\nHe said those special experiences or items — when properly spaced out — bring him way more joy than the same amount spent on frequent smaller treats.\nAt the same time, he also makes sure to build in a buffer for unexpected opportunities.\n“Sometimes amazing deals come up and having that dedicated luxury fund means I can jump on them without messing up my regular budget,” he said. “Last month, I snagged some seriously discounted first-class tickets because I had the funds ready to go.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Used Luxury SUVs That Are a Good Investment for Retirees\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n7 Overpriced Grocery Items Frugal People Should Quit Buying in 2025\n4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How To Allocate Parts of Your Paycheck for Intermittent Luxury Splurges\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}
{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/households-west-have-most-debt-experts-explain-why","Article":"Credit, like a mortgage, a car loan or a student loan, can often help individuals and families get ahead in America. But debt isn’t distributed evenly throughout the country, and when households accumulate too much debt, it can be difficult to keep up with payments.\nLearn More: What Salary Single People Need To Live Comfortably in 100 Major US Cities\nRead Next: 4 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\nHouseholds in the West have the most delinquent debt. According to credit data from August 2023 collected by the Urban Institute, numerous western states have debt in collection that exceeds the national rate of 22%. For example, Nevada’s delinquent debt rate is 27%, Arizona’s rate is 23% and New Mexico’s rate is 26%.\nSeveral factors contribute to the fact that western states have higher amounts of debt than the rest of the country, and GOBankingRates spoke with experts to unpack this trend.\nAlso find out how much a $100,000 salary looks like after taxes in the West.\nHigher Housing Costs\nAccording to Statista, the average sales price of a new home in the United States was $512,200 in 2024, but home prices can be much higher in the West.\nAccording to Kiplinger, in San Jose, California, which has a median household income of $153,202, the average home price is $1,923,230. Similarly, homes in Orange County, California average $1,509,257, while the area’s median household income is $110,042. Arizona also had an average home price of $1,160,346, while the median household income is $66,264.\n“In my work helping customers manage credit obligations, I’ve observed that mortgage debt in these regions typically consumes 40% to 50% of household income, compared to 25% to 35% in the Midwest,” explained Kevin Shahnazari, founder and CEO of FinlyWealth.\nHousing scarcity also impacts the housing costs and the debt patterns. According to Shahnazari, strict zoning laws, environmental regulations and geographic limitations, like mountains and coastlines, contribute to housing shortages, which drive up prices and prompt homeowners to assume larger mortgages.\nTrending Now: 6 Key Signs a Housing Market Will Soon Have Massive Price Drops\nMelanie Musson, a finance expert with InsuranceProviders.com, explained that the growth the West is experiencing is partially due to an influx of people moving into the area.\n“Many of the people who live in cities and towns didn’t grow up there,” she explained. “They’re coming into the area with outside money. Instead of people growing up in the area and settling it organically, there’s forced growth from outsiders moving in.”\nSuch growth is further contributing to rising housing costs and household debt.\nLimited Incomes\nMany residents of Western states face these high home prices on limited incomes. Shahnazari explained that high-income tech jobs are present in the Western market, but these opportunities tend to be concentrated in urban centers.\n“The broader region includes many rural and service economy areas where wages stagnate despite rising living costs,” he said. “Nevada, Idaho and parts of Oregon exemplify this pattern: Residents face Western region costs but with income levels closer to national averages.”\nAccording to Musson, many businesses in the West face high operating and overhead costs. If they pay employees salaries needed to make a living in the area, the businesses can’t stay in operation.\n“So, in order to stay in business, companies have to pay employees lower wages so the business can pay for rent and stay solvent,” she said.\nHigher Cost of Living\nHouseholds in the West also feature an unusually high cost of living. According to the World Population Review, the 2025 cost of living in California is 144.8, meaning it’s 44.8% higher than the national average of 100. Washington’s cost of living is 114.2, Oregon’s is 112 and Arizona’s is 111.5.\nSince the cost of living encompasses grocery, housing, utility, transportation and health costs, it’s easy to see how paying down debt on top of covering everyday costs can be challenging.\n“Higher cost of living is the number one reason debt is so high in the West,” explained Musson. “Lower incomes coupled with higher cost of living make the problem even worse.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Luxury Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Spring 2025\n4 Things You Should Do if You Want To Retire Early\n7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\n5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Households in the West Have the Most Debt — Experts Explain Why\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"aacg","Article_title":""}
{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/here-what-know-beyond-why-snowflake-inc-snow-trending-stock-1","Article":"Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this company have returned -8.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Snowflake belongs, has lost 13% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Snowflake is expected to post earnings of $0.22 per share, indicating a change of +57.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.15 points to a change of +38.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.56 indicates a change of +35.8% from what Snowflake is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The EPS surprise was +76.47%.\nOver the last four quarters, Snowflake surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nSnowflake is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/heres-why-cra-international-crai-strong-value-stock-1","Article":"Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.\nFeaturing daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\nThe Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\nEach stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nGrowth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum traders and investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.\nVGM Score\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nThe Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nWith more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nYou want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.\nAs mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: CRA International (CRAI)\nHeadquartered in Boston, MA, Charles River Associates is one of the leading global consulting firms. The company functions through a global network of coordinated offices across North America and Europe. It was founded in 1965.\nCRAI is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P\/E ratio of 20.99; value investors should take notice.\nFor fiscal 2025, three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.23 to $7.75 per share. CRAI boasts an average earnings surprise of 25.9%.\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, CRAI should be on investors' short list.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Rigetti Computing belongs, has lost 13% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends.

EPS of $1.02 for the same period compares with $0.75 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.43%. The EPS surprise was +13.33%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S), and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nJD.com is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about JD.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/here-what-know-beyond-why-cleanspark-inc-clsk-trending-stock-0","Article":"CleanSpark (CLSK) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which CleanSpark falls in, has lost 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nCleanSpark is expected to post earnings of $0.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -84.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $0.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +476.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.44 indicates a change of -55.1% from what CleanSpark is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CleanSpark.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor CleanSpark, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $191.98 million indicates a year-over-year change of +71.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $810.72 million and $1.04 billion estimates indicate +113.9% and +27.7% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nCleanSpark reported revenues of $162.31 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +120%. EPS of -$0.07 for the same period compares with -$0.02 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $152.71 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.28%. The EPS surprise was +12.5%.\nOver the last four quarters, CleanSpark surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P\/E), price-to-sales (P\/S) and price-to-cash flow (P\/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nCleanSpark is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CleanSpark. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\nFeaturing daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.\nIt also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\nDeveloped alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\nEach stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nFinding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying \"the trend is your friend.\" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.\nVGM Score\nWhat if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\n#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nThis totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\nFor instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: RTX (RTX)\nIn July 2023, Raytheon Technologies was renamed as RTX Corporation. On Apr 3, 2020, Raytheon Technologies was formed following the completion of merger between United Technologies and Raytheon Company. Based in Waltham, MA, Raytheon Technologies has emerged as an aerospace and defense company, with pro-forma combined annual revenues of $74 billion as of the end of 2019, providing advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers worldwide. Effective July 2023, the company operates through three business segments.\nRTX is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\nAdditionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. RTX has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 7% for the current fiscal year.\nTwo analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $6.13 per share. RTX boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.9%.\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, RTX should be on investors' short list.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

{"Date":"2025-04-18","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/heres-why-primo-brands-prmb-great-momentum-stock-buy","Article":"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Primo Brands (PRMB), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Primo Brands currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PRMB that show why this maker of pure-play water solutions shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\nFor PRMB, shares are up 1.2% over the past week while the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry is up 1.2% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.55% compares favorably with the industry's 2.71% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Primo Brands have risen 3.01%, and are up 85.15% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved -11.63% and 6.63%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of PRMB's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PRMB is averaging 4,928,243 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PRMB.\nOver the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PRMB's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.23 to $1.59 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PRMB is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Primo Brands on your short list.\nZacks Names #1 Semiconductor Stock\nIt's only 1\/9,000th the size of NVIDIA which skyrocketed more than +800% since we recommended it. NVIDIA is still strong, but our new top chip stock has much more room to boom.\nWith strong earnings growth and an expanding customer base, it's positioned to feed the rampant demand for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things. Global semiconductor manufacturing is projected to explode from $452 billion in 2021 to $803 billion by 2028.\nSee This Stock Now for Free >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.\nThe research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.\nZacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.\nWhat are the Zacks Style Scores?\nThe Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.\nBased on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.\nThe Style Scores are broken down into four categories:\nValue Score\nValue investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P\/E, PEG, Price\/Sales, Price\/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.\nGrowth Score\nWhile good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.\nMomentum Score\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\nVGM Score\nIf you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.\nHow Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank\nA proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.\nIt's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.\nThis totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.\nThat's where the Style Scores come in.\nTo maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\nThe direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.\nHere's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: Gilead Sciences (GILD)\nHeadquartered in Foster City, CA, Gilead Sciences is a pioneer in developing drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The company’s broad portfolio includes drugs for liver diseases, hematology\/oncology diseases and inflammation\/respiratory diseases. Gilead has a strong HIV franchise with flagship treatment Biktarvy driving the growth. The company’s efforts to develop innovative HIV treatments for prevention are impressive as well. Total sales from the HIV franchise were $19.6 billion in 2024, up 8% year over year, driven by strong growth in lead HIV treatment Biktarvy.\nGILD is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\nIt also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P\/E ratio of 13.31; value investors should take notice.\nFor fiscal 2025, five analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $7.86 per share. GILD boasts an average earnings surprise of 19.5%.\nWith a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, GILD should be on investors' short list.\nResearch Chief Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nThis company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren’t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.\nFree: See Our Top Stock And 4 Runners Up\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.\nAs mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.\nA stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.\nThus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.\nStock to Watch: Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)\nHeadquartered in Jacksonville, FL, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. provides banking and payments technology solutions, processing services and information-based services to the financial services industry. The company came into existence, following the merger with Certegy Inc., a provider of credit cards, debit cards, other transaction processing and check risk management services to financial institutions in 2006.\nFIS is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.\nMomentum investors should take note of this Business Services stock.

{"Date":"2023-08-31","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/ata-creativity-global-adr-aacg-price-target-increased-by-10.00-to-11.22","Article":"Rent-A-Center Inc. ( RCII ), one of the largest rent-to-own operators, delivered third-quarter 2012 earnings of 67 cents a share that came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and increased 11.7% from 60 cents earned in the prior-year quarter, aided by top line growth.\nRent-A-Center's total revenue, which comprises store and franchise revenues, rose 5% to $739.3 million from the year-ago quarter but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $757 million. Comparable-store sales for the quarter rose 1.2%. The increase in the top line was attributable to higher revenue from the RAC Acceptance segment, partly mitigated by a decline in the Core U.S. segment.\nThe company's business model, called RAC Acceptance, is gaining traction. When a consumer is denied credit financing for a particular product from the retailer, Rent-A-Center acquires that product from the retailer by virtue of the RAC Acceptance program, and thereby offers it to the consumer under a rental-purchase transaction.\nRevenue from the RAC Acceptance business surged 63.4% to $83.8 million from the prior-year quarter, whereas revenue from Core U.S. segment edged down 0.8% to $634.6 million. International segment revenue came in at $10.9 million substantially up from $4.7 million in the year-ago quarter.\nTotal store revenue rose 4.8% to $729.3 million. The growth was driven by 4.8% advancement in rental and fees revenue to $652.1 million and an 11.5% increase in merchandise sales to $58.9 million, partially offset by a 4.8% decline in installment sales to $15.6 million and 32.2% decrease in other revenue to $2.8 million. Total franchise revenue (ColorTyme segment) climbed 18% to $10 million during the quarter.\nWe observe that higher cost of revenues kept the gross margin under pressure. Although, Rent-A-Center's gross profit grew 2.7% to $519.3 million, gross margin shrunk 160 basis points to 70.2%. Cost of rentals and fees rose 11.2% to $158.8 million, whereas cost of merchandise sold grew 10% to $47.5 million.\nOperating profit rose 4.2% to $68.1 million, whereas operating profit margin contracted 10 basis points to 9.2%. Adjusted EBITDA climbed 7.5% to $89 million, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 12%.\nStores Update\nDuring the quarter, the company opened 11 new Core U.S. locations, acquired 2 stores and closed 3 stores (2 stores consolidated with existing locations and 1 location closed) bringing the total store count to 2,983. The company also opened 100 RAC Acceptance stores and closed 29 stores (consolidated with existing locations), resulting in 882 stores.\nSixteen international locations were opened and 1 store was shuttered (consolidated with existing locations) during the quarter bringing the count to 114 stores. ColorTyme, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rent-A-Center, added 5 new locations and closed 4 stores, taking the total store count to 220.\nFor 2012, management plans to open approximately 35 domestic rent-to-own stores. Through the year, the company targets to open 40 rent-to-own locations in Mexico and 6 in Canada. Moreover, the company aims 300 domestic RAC Acceptance kiosk additions.\nOther Financial Aspects\nRent-A-Center ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $81.8 million, senior debt of $293.3 million, and shareholders' equity of $1,460.8 million. During the first-nine months of 2012, the company generated cash flow from operations of about $258.7 million. Management reiterated capital expenditures of approximately $105 million for 2012.\nDuring the first-nine months of 2012, the company bought back 866,985 shares for approximately $30.1 million. Since the inception of the share buyback program, the company has repurchased 30,189,738 shares and has employed approximately $745.6 million out of the $800 million authorized. The company's Board of Directors enhanced the share repurchase authorization by an additional $200 million to $1 billion.\nStrolling Through Guidance\nRent-A-Center projects 2012 top-line growth between 7% and 8.5%, attributable to a low single-digit jump in Core U.S. segment and more than $325 million contribution from the RAC Acceptance business. Management expects comparable-store sales growth of 2% for the fourth quarter and 2012.\nManagement envisions 2012 earnings in the band of $3.05 to $3.15 per share, including 30 cents cost related to its international expansion initiatives. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 is $3.14 that lies near the upper-end of the guidance range.\nManagement also forecasted a 175 basis points contraction in gross profit margin for 2012. It also hinted a 50 basis points reduction in operating profit margin for the year.\nClosing Comment\nCurrently, we have a long-term Outperform recommendation on the stock, given its sustained top and bottom lines growth for the past four quarters. However, Rent-A-Center, which competes with Aaron's Inc. ( AAN ) and Advance America, holds a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term Sell rating as margins remained under pressure due to higher expenses.\nRent-A-Center offers consumer electronics, appliances and furniture products under rental purchase schemes that allow customers to own the merchandise upon the completion of the rental period. Due to continued tightening of the credit market, customers see rent-to-own as a more flexible and viable option compared to credit. However, the sluggish recovery and a fragile job market may make customers reluctant to enter new rental-purchase deals.\n(AAN): ETF Research Reports\nRENT-A-CENTER (RCII): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\nZacks Investment Research\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"ATA Creativity Global - ADR (AACG) Price Target Increased by 10.00% to 11.22"}

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2012 is 61 cents per share (year-over-year increase of 14.62%) on revenues of $1,827 million (year-over-year increase of 24.8%).\nSecond-quarter 2012, a Synopsis\nCMS Energy Corporation announced adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share for the second quarter of 2012, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. The results were also higher than the year-ago earnings of 26 cents per share. On a reported basis, the company recorded earnings of 37 cents per share versus 38 cents in the year-ago quarter. In the reported quarter, the variance of 3 cents between earnings on a reported and adjusted basis is attributable to the effect of a voluntary employee separation program that was implemented in the same period.\nOperating revenue of CMS Energy in the quarter under review grossed $1.33 billion, down 2.3% year over year. Results were also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $214 million.\nOperating expenses in the quarter fell $1.07 billion from $1.16 billion year over year. CMS Energy reported operating income of $260 million versus $207 million in the year-ago quarter. Overall, the company reported net income of $100 million, flat with the year-ago quarter.\nRead our full coverage on this earnings report: CMS Energy Beats EPS, Misses Rev.\nGuidance for 2012\nCMS Energy expects adjusted earnings for full-year 2012 in the range of $1.52-$1.55 per share. This is consistent with the company's long-term plan of 5%-7% annual earnings growth.\nZacks Consensus\nThe analysts covered by Zacks expect CMS Energy to post third-quarter 2012 earnings of 61 cents per share, higher than 53 cents delivered in the prior-year quarter. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate ranges between earnings of 58 cents and 62 cents a share.\nFor 2012, the Zacks Consensus Estimate stood at $1.55 per share, higher than its prior-year earnings of $1.46 per share. The current Zacks Estimate ranges between $1.53 and $1.60 per share.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nAgreement\nWe do not see any change for the third quarter as well as full year 2012. None of the estimates moved upward or downward for the last 7 days or 30 days for both third quarter as well as full year 2012.\nThe analysts seem to be neutral for both the current quarter and for full year 2012.\nMagnitude\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter 2012 remained stagnant at 61 cents over the last 30 days. For full-year 2012 also, the consensus estimate remained static at $1.55 for the 30 day period.\nSurprise History\nWith respect to earnings surprises, CMS Energy Corporation has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters. The average surprise over the last four quarter remained at positive 2.68%. The earnings beat in December 2011 was the highest at 6.67%.\nOur Recommendation\nCMS Energy's regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate a relatively stable and growing earnings stream. With its robust pipeline of regulated investment opportunities and favorable regulatory treatment, the company remains on track to achieve its long-term earnings per share growth target of 5% to 7% and annual rate base growth of 6% to 7%. CMS Energy is focusing on cost management. The company intends to reduce its operations and maintenance costs by 4% this year and cut down the number of employees by 3%. This will definitely help the company to boost its profits.\nHowever, we remain concerned about the unfavorable macro backdrop, economic condition in Michigan, and regulatory cases. Like its peer, Ameren Corporation ( AEE ) CMS Energy presently retains a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) that corresponds with our long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.\nCMS Energy Corporation is the holding company of Consumers Energy Company (Consumers) and CMS Enterprises Company (Enterprises).

It is yet another heavy week of earnings on the schedule for investment professionals and investors alike.\nWe had a handful of earnings-related plays moving throughout the session. On the upside, Peabody Energy ( BTU ) and Caterpillar ( CAT ) bounced higher following recent sell-offs for both names. Meanwhile, Advance Auto Parts ( AAP ) shares got hit hard as the car parts retailer warned about its profit picture for the rest of 2012. V.F. Corporation ( VFC ) was also seeing some profit-taking, despite solid numbers and a generous hike in its dividend payout. Apple ( AAPL ) shares had a big day following analysts lifting earnings estimates ahead of Thursday afternoon's report.\nElsewhere, Wall Street analyst calls are moving some shares. Eaton Corp ( ETN ) is moving up on positive analyst commentary, while shares of residential REIT giant Equity Residential ( EQR ) are seeing red on a rare \"Sell\" call.\nYankee Fan Syndrome (Many Have it)\nIf you were watching Major League Baseball's playoff action last week, you probably saw the New York Yankees get swept in a four-game series against the Detroit Tigers. It was a bit surprising to see a team with the highest payroll in all of baseball (Yankees) go down with very little fight. Not just that, but there was controversy surrounding the immortal (as some baseball watchers like to term him) Alex Rodriguez and his in-game distractions. Aapparently A-Rod (as he's known) was paying more attention to a couple of attractive female fans in the first row than to the game itself. Of course, his behavior did not sit well with die-hard Yankee fans who are now hoping the team finds Mr. Rodriguez a new home this winter.\nAnother interesting development to note was the multitude of empty seats in Yankee Stadium during the club's first two home games in the playoffs. Listening to sports talk radio, show hosts and callers offered several reasons why so little fans packed the stadium. Factors cited included expensive tickets (that has never stopped the biggest fans from attending before), a tough economy (certainly a viable reason but we have not seen this occur in many of the other teams who have made the playoffs), and finally, the fact that Yankee fans have been spoiled, with the club making the playoffs just about every year for the last couple of decades (now I think we're getting closer to the real reason).\nI have often pointed out that years of continued success have significant effects on people. In sports, it is almost impossible to repeat as champions, coming off the high of winning and having to go back to square one to do it all over again. Many don't have the hunger or desire to put the same original effort it took to win it the first time. With regard to Yankee fans, it's pretty likely some decided to wait till the World Series to actually attend the game. Many probably assumed the Yankees would make it to the championship. After all, they were superb during the regular season, and the experts expected the World Series was a likelihood for the Yankee franchise once again. Complacency kicks in for many tied to the organization (management, players, fans, media, etc.) and next thing you know, they are watching other players\/teams playing for the title.\nThis sort of complacency is everywhere I turn (half-emtpy churches on Sundays is quite the norm these days; kids with the highest end tech gadgets before they are in even middle school; a potential terrorist hit last week targeting the Federal Reserve, and within 24 hours the story is at the bottom of most major media news outlets - wasn't a successful hit so \"no biggie\" I guess, etc.). The jobs situation is abysmal and yet all the news outlets focus instead on home sales and retail numbers, patting the consumer on his back for being \"resilient.\"\nIt's not that spending money should be considered evil, but the action of spending must make sense for the individual. Spending should not be yet another financial weight that will hold one back from using money in a better way. Saving and investing is so much more important than feeding into the media's message to keep the economy racing forward. Your responsibility is to yourself and your family to put them in the best financial situation possible, and then from there decide what makes sense from a financial spending standpoint. The chance to get loaded with debt is everywhere you turn, but with a good sense of discipline you can avoid the complacent justification of being broke like most everyone else is.\nWe all have the opportunity to lead by example and set the tone for how our families push forward financially. These examples will lead to smarter generations to come. Just don't catch the complacency syndrome.\nI hope everyone had a chance to check out our Dividend.com Premium members-only weekend articles , including new features that highlight some of the biggest winners and losers from the week that was, such as analyst upgrades\/downgrades and earnings\/story stocks.

And not surprisingly, its performance tracks price volatility of the red and yellow metals, its primary products.\nThe good news for the past cou-ple months: The direction of both producer and metals has been mostly up. With the Federal Reserve extend-ing its loose money policy indefinite-ly with a third round of quantitative easing or \"QE3,\" more upside likely lies ahead.\nThere's not much if any evidence now of rising wages, such as spurred the inflationary spiral of the 1970s. Nonetheless, QE3 is at its heart a \"weak dollar\" policy-and in the past, that's been a sure-fire catalyst for higher US dollar prices of natural re-sources from oil to copper and gold. Meanwhile, the company continues to adhere to its bullish strategy for growth, with five \"super mines\" in de-velopment around the world.\nMining stocks are the ideal way to play the trend, because their earnings are leveraged to the prices of the met-als they produce. A move in copper from $3.00 to $3.50 a pound means a 16.7 percent return for the owner of the raw commodity, but it doubles the profits of a miner producing the red metal for $2.50 in total costs. As a result, mining stocks tend to outper-form metals in bull markets and un-derperform in bear markets.\nFor the better part of 2012, Free-port shares badly lagged the mostly retreating prices of copper and gold. Since late August, however, the roles have reversed, and we're now in the black on the position.\nFreeport's rising production pro-file is another key catalyst for high-er future earnings and share price. In an age where miners are forced to go ever deeper, ever further and into ever more danger to keep up with demand, the company's projects in the Amer-icas alone are on track to produce roughly by 2016 what it produces globally now.\nThat adds up to an overall boost of as much as 50 percent in four years, even as the company continues its high-margin business of mining gold and molybdenum, the latter used to make high-performance steel.\nFreeport has a history of pouring rising production and profits into divi-dend increases . The May 2012 pay-out was raised 25 percent from the previous level, for a 317 percent to-tal increase in two years. And there's almost surely more where that came from.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"Dyson faces claims from former workers at Malaysian supplier"}

The study was being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type II diabetes.\nThe study was terminated after the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended discontinuation of the study due to safety concerns. It was found that a higher number of serious adverse events and mortality was associated with the use of bardoxolone methyl.\nInvestors have reacted negatively to the news with Abbott Labs' share price falling 3.5% on the news.\nAbbott Labs and Reata Pharma had announced the initiation of the phase III study in mid-2011. The discontinuation of the BEACON study is a huge disappointment for Abbott Labs, which remains on track to split into two separate publicly traded companies from January 1, 2013.

Biogen had submitted the NDA in March. The NDA was based on data from the phase III DEFINE and CONFIRM studies which showed that treatment with BG-12 led to a significant reduction in disease activity in multiple sclerosis patients. Moreover, the candidate had a favorable safety and tolerability profile.\nThe extension of the FDA's review period means that a response regarding BG-12's approvability should be out in March-April 2013 instead of later this year. Importantly, the FDA did not ask for additional studies.\nBiogen is the market leader in therapies for the treatment of MS. The company's key products include Avonex and Tysabri. Biogen has been working on strengthening its position in the MS market. We believe BG-12 could become a leader in the oral MS market once launched. Biogen is also studying BG-12 as a combination therapy.\nMeanwhile, Biogen and partner Abbott Labs ( ABT ) moved another MS candidate, daclizumab, into a two-year phase III study (DECIDE) in July 2010, with results due in 2014.

{"Date":"2021-11-25","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/analysts-see-years-of-losses-at-malaysias-ata-after-major-client-dyson-cuts-ties","Article":"Submitted byThe Life Sciencesas part of our contributors program .\nInterview conducted by George S. Mack of The Life Sciences Report (10\/18\/12)\nBiotech stocks move on material news, which means clinical data, regulatory progress, new partnerships and big contracts with new customers. Analyst Ed Arce of MLV & Co. holds to these principles as he shares compelling biotech names in this exclusive interview with The Life Sciences Report .\nThe Life Sciences Report: Your experience is very broad. Just four or five years ago, you were a big pharma analyst at a major investment bank, where you followed the largest drug makers in the world. From your perspective today, as an analyst following small-cap biotech and medtech, can you talk about the clinical assets that drive value in smaller companies?\nEd Arce: From a market perspective, the key value drivers largely remain the same. First, and by far most important, are the clinical data. The stronger the efficacy, the better. But meeting clinical endpoints needs to translate into a clinically meaningful benefit. An outright therapeutic cure is optimal, but is also quite rare. Also, the overall safety and tolerability profile of any new therapeutic must be commensurate with the severity of the disease, and comparable to the risk profiles of any existing pharmacotherapies. Risk\/benefit is obviously a trade-off. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in attempting to balance the risk\/benefit equation, has leaned a bit in one direction or the other over the years.\nThe second point, from a market perspective, is the size of the patient population and the degree to which that population has been, or is, treatment na?ve.\nThe third point is value driven by a long product life, in the form of a long-dated patent suite, as well as any regulatory exclusivity offered to the drug.\nLast would be pricing. This has, for a long time, been strongly correlated to the strength of the data, and rightly so. But increasingly, companies are focusing one or more of their development programs on rare diseases that qualify for the FDA's orphan indication, with the candidate drug being entitled to marketing exclusivity. In these cases, the pricing is much higher than in broader indications.\nTLSR: You have alluded to a very interesting point regarding orphan indications-incentives from the FDA for developing these products and the pricing models available to companies for focusing on rare diseases. It seems to prove that these programs have been effective, does it not?\nEA: Yes. The FDA's orphan drug programs have been among the most successful over the last couple decades. Originally the industry was a bit slow to pick up on the commercial opportunity, but now, and over the last few years, there has been a resurgence and an awakening to the commercial opportunities concerning all of the program's aspects, which include market exclusivity, tax benefits and the other items. The incentives make development of orphan drugs a much more profitable proposition.\nTLSR: You follow a few medical technology companies in addition to biotechnology companies. Do you find differences in the way the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) treats device companies versus drug companies? What variances have you noticed with regard to allowing reimbursement for devices versus drugs?\nEA: I've come to believe that there are, in many cases, more hurdles regarding reimbursement for devices than for drugs. Specifically, I think devices are much more likely to experience incremental, piecemeal reimbursement approvals by private payers across the country, even after CMS allowance. Typically, private-pay reimbursement is much more rapid and uniform with drugs.\nTLSR: Generally speaking, where do opportunities lie for investors?\nEA: My focus is on companies and their fundamentals. In that regard, opportunities for upside lie specifically with those companies that have impactful and near-term catalytic events ahead of them.\nTLSR: With that bottom-up theory, let's talk about some of your favorite ideas. Pick one that you like.\nEA: The first one I'll mention is NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NPSP:NASDAQ). NPS is a biotech company focused on developing orphan therapeutics for rare gastrointestinal and endocrine disorders. We believe its lead development product, Gattex (teduglutide), for short bowel syndrome, is a key, near-term value driver.\nGattex was recently evaluated by the FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee and the panel voted unanimously in favor of FDA approval. We believe Gattex significantly restores intestinal absorption to patients and offers most of them one or more days off the expensive standard-of-care therapy, which is parenteral nutrition (PN). Not only is chronic PN treatment a huge burden for these patients, it dramatically decreases their quality of life, and it comes with some serious complications, including catheter-related infections and even liver disease. I think the likelihood is quite high that Gattex gains FDA approval on or before its Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Dec. 30.\nNPS also has a second, late-stage compound in Natpara (recombinant human parathyroid hormone [rhPTH 1-84]), for hypoparathyroidism. If approved, Natpara would be offered as a hormone replacement therapy for patients who have no other alternative than to take huge daily doses of oral calcium and vitamin D. NPS expects to file a biologics license application (BLA) for Natpara in mid-2013.\nTLSR: Is short bowel syndrome a surgical phenomenon, or is this product for congenital conditions?\nEA: It is actually both, but the lion's share of the patient population has had surgery, which is a treatment sometimes recommended for Crohn's disease. In other cases surgery might have been for treatment related to cancers.\nTLSR: How does Gattex actually work? Is this an active transport type of mechanism in the bowel, able to increase permeability across cell membranes?\nEA: Teduglutide is a recombinant glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analog. It acts as a growth hormone specific to the intestines. It has been shown in tests to increase the restoration of the epithelial cells making up the intestinal lining. That increases the level of absorption for the remaining section of the bowel.\nTLSR: What is the market opportunity for Gattex and Natpara? How big is it?\nEA: In the U.S., there are estimates of between 10,000-15,000 patients who have short bowel syndrome and are dependent on parenteral nutrition. That would be the key target patient population for Gattex. With Natpara, for hypoparathyroidism, estimates range from 65,000-80,000 patients in the U.S.\nTLSR: What do those numbers translate to in dollars?\nEA: We believe both of these could generate several hundred million dollars in peak sales for NPS.\nTLSR: NPS has an $800 million ($800M) market cap. The market opportunity is significant.\nEA: Yes, it would be significant. Both products have solid patent protection out to the middle of the 2020s. I want to point out that Gattex is known as Revestive in the European Union ( EU ), and it received European market approval in September 2012. The approval was received with NPS' partner, Nycomed, which was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (TKPYY:OTCPK). Revestive is now in the process of launching country-by-country through the region. NPS earns mid-teen royalties from sales of the drug in the EU. For both Natpara and Gattex, once they are approved, sales in North America would accrue entirely to NPS.\nTLSR: Both of these indications are relatively rare. The endocrinologist would be managing the hypoparathyroidism, and the gastroenterologist or internist would be managing the short bowel syndrome. You don't need a huge sales force for either of these products, do you?\nEA: That's right. In fact, NPS has been diligently preparing for the launch of Gattex for more than a year now. The company is preparing the infrastructure and starting with key managers on the commercial side. The company is now in the process of following up with medical science liaisons. It is also working with patient advocacy groups and others to get the best understanding of where the target patient population is, who treats those patients and how to manage that treatment.\nTLSR: Gattex's PDUFA date is Dec. 30. Do you generally expect a stock to sell off on the good news when the drug is approved?\nEA: That has been happening with more frequency lately. It all depends on how much the stock has run up in the months before the advisory committee date, and then how much it may have run up between the time of the advisory committee and the PDUFA date. It also depends on the investor base. In the case of NPS, I think the company has a very solid, long-term institutional shareholder base that largely reduces that risk. The institutional shareholders are about 90%.\nTLSR: That's pretty high. How do you bid up the price of shares when 90% are already owned by institutional investors? Those shares could actually be a source of supply. But that may be a rhetorical question. Do you expect sales of Gattex, starting in January 2013 or thereafter, to begin driving this stock again?\nEA: It wouldn't surprise me if, after the run-up following the advisory committee and the approval, the stock traded sideways for the first two months of 2013, as we get an idea of what the early launch sales trajectory looks like. But I would also mention that in the same timeframe-the first few months of next year-NPS will be wrapping up its BLA for Natpara. These two important compounds are back-to-back, and serve as incremental catalysts for the stock now and well into 2013.\nTLSR: What is your next idea?\nEA: I like BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BCRX:NASDAQ), a pharmaceutical company developing novel small molecules that block key enzymes involved in inflammatory and infectious diseases. It utilizes its state-of-the-art crystallography lab to do structured, guided drug design. It has two late-stage compounds, and the key value driver is its compound for gout, ulodesine. The main catalyst is that this drug is phase 3-ready, following positive results reported earlier this year. The catalyst that investors are awaiting is announcement of a development and commercialization collaboration with a partner to undertake the phase 3 program, and ultimately to commercialize the product.\nTLSR: You have said that you consider gout to be an untapped market. Allopurinol has been on the market for the longest time, and other generics, such as probenecid, are available. There are also newer products, such as Takeda's Uloric (febuxostat) and Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (SVNT:NASDAQ) Krystexxa (pegloticase). Also, AstraZeneca Plc (AZN:NYSE) has a product, lesinurad, that has been in phase 3 studies now for a year. Why is ulodesine so important? Why do you think of gout as an untapped market, with all the other products out there?\nEA: On face value, I agree with you. It would seem that there are several products addressing this condition. But let's go over them one by one. First of all, you're right: The standard of care, used to treat well over 90% of patients, is the widely genericized drug allopurinol, which has been around for 40+ years. Despite the entrance of Krystexxa and Uloric, that has not changed much over the last few years. Uloric is a slightly more efficacious version of allopurinol. It works by the same mechanism of action, and given that it produces incremental improvement, it hasn't garnered much market share relative to the much cheaper generic alternative. At the other end of the spectrum is Krystexxa. This is a potent drug, is an injectable and is intended for the most severe gout patients, those who have severe tophaceous gout that is not responding to allopurinol. Even by its own label, Krystexxa is targeting a subset of patients who suffer from the worst symptoms.\nEssentially, the majority of patients who have gout-in fact, about 60% of them-are on treatment but are underserved and are not reaching the therapeutic goal, which is to reduce serum uric acid levels to below 6 milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dL). Until patients reach that level, they will likely continue to experience sporadic episodes of painful gout flares. The only way to address the underlying condition is to reduce the uric acid level well below the 6 mg\/dL. The two lead, late-stage compounds in development, as you mentioned, are ulodesine and AstraZeneca's lesinurad.\nTLSR: I understand that the phase 2 data for combination therapy of ulodesine and allopurinol showed a doubled response rate versus the control arm of allopurinol alone. Are you concerned about the toxicity of these two products used together? Is that going to be the major risk factor to share price as this combination enters phase 3?\nEA: There have been, in the past, some concerns about the safety profile of ulodesine given the mechanism of action. There are specific actions with ulodesine in combination with allopurinol that act synergistically in the urate metabolic pathway. The question about the safety has been, in my view, answered thoroughly by tests done on infection rates in both B cells and T cells. My view is that the drug is safe and well tolerated.\nTLSR: BioCryst is a small-cap company with a $204M market valuation. The company has about $54M in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, and that should hold it for another 18 months or so. Is the company going to be squeezed into giving away too many points when it licenses ulodesine?\nEA: No, I don't think so. In fact, I think the company is in a rather strong position to negotiate some favorable terms with a future partner because of the market dynamic we've just discussed. Ulodesine is the last remaining, unpartnered, late-stage gout compound.\nWe also expect that in the interim, the company's second-lead late-stage compound, peramivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor for influenza, could wrap up its phase 3 trial and show some positive data by late next year. The trial is evaluating intravenous peramivir in patients with acute influenza in the hospital setting. If it is approved on the basis of positive phase 3 data, it is highly likely that the U.S. government, in the form of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), will grant a contract for $100M or more, just based on BARDA's past purchases of these types of drugs, both influenza vaccines and antivirals.\nTLSR: Even with thin margins, that amount of money is going to be important for the company. Is the Street giving peramivir any value currently, or is it a call option?\nEA: It really is a call option. At this point, I include it in my model and valuation because I believe the data speak highly to the prospects for approval. Of course, it is appropriately risk-adjusted. But having said that, I don't think peramivir has been given much credit by the Street. It will be a significant catalyst when the data come out positively.\nTLSR: Another idea?\nEA: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND:NASDAQ) is a biotechnology company that has been around since the mid-1990s, but it has been through several iterations. Today it has a large, diverse pipeline of mostly partnered assets that are in various stages, from preclinical through phase 3. Several of those assets are now generating royalties.\nIn addition, it acquired CyDex Pharmaceuticals Inc. in January 2011. Through that acquisition the company now has the Captisol (a polyanionic beta-cyclodextrin derivative) formulation platform technology, which is in six marketed drugs as well as a handful of compounds that are in the clinic.\nGoing forward, Ligand has two key value drivers. The first is Kyprolis (carfilzomib). This is Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (ONXX:NASDAQ) drug for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, which was just approved by the FDA a few months ago. Indications are that the launch with Onyx is going well. Ligand, because of its formulation technology with Captisol, gets 1.5-3% of annual sales. Normally this percentage would be considered small-and perhaps even insignificant-but for a company the size of Ligand, with a $336M market cap, and for the market opportunity that we see in Kyprolis, specifically for patients who have come to the end of the line and have no therapeutic alternatives left, we see this as one of the key value drivers, especially starting next year.\nTLSR: Kyprolis is labeled as a third-line therapy for multiple myeloma. The patient has to fail two prior therapies, including Velcade (bortezomib; Takeda). Is the company doing studies to advance this product to earlier-stage disease or earlier-stage treatment?\nEA: There are late-stage studies evaluating just that question. I think that as the months roll over and prescribing physicians gain more experience with the drug, some off-label prescribing could occur on the margins, because there is the view that Kyprolis could be both efficacious and safe.\nTLSR: Is there another company you wanted to talk about?\nEA: Affymax Inc. (AFFY:NASDAQ) is a very interesting story. The company is known for its drug Omontys (peginesatide), a treatment for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on dialysis. Omontys is a synthetic, pegylated, peptidic compound that binds to and stimulates the erythropoietin receptor. It is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESA ), like Amgen Inc.'s (AMGN:NASDAQ) Epogen (epoetin alfa). The key difference is that Omontys is administered once a month for dialysis patients, as opposed to three times a week, typically, with Epogen. Earlier this year Affymax and its partner, Takeda, were granted approval before the PDUFA date, and the product has been doing very well in the first few months of its launch.\nTLSR: I find this company so interesting. The stock performance is off the chart, up 385% over the past 12 months and up 100% in the past three months. It flagged after the drug was approved, and then it seemed to take off on new contracts with dialysis providers. Those were the great big catalysts for the company.\nEA: In fact, within fewer than three months after approval, the company signed an initial supply agreement with the world's largest dialysis provider, Fresenius Medical Care (FMS:NYSE), which became an early adopter of Omontys. The initial contract, signed in July, was for a little more than 100 dialysis centers in the U.S., representing about 10,000 patients. In August, Affymax signed with U.S. Renal Care.\nThe bigger picture is that Epogen has been the only ESA available to dialysis patients for more than 20 years. This was a long-standing monopoly with monopoly pricing. Affymax has been very successful in the first few months of the Omontys launch, and it is getting some key suppliers to adopt the product. In fact, we think it's likely, perhaps even as early as the end of this year, that Fresenius and Affymax will announce a longer-term and much broader, comprehensive agreement to supply Omontys throughout all of its dialysis centers, or many more of its dialysis centers than it currently does.\nTLSR: Ed, thank you so much for your time.\nEA: Thank you very much.

In the three months, Fisher had more than 260 transactions, more than 90 of them reductions, densely selling in the financial, energy, industrial and technology sectors.\nHis highest reduction amounts belonged to the financial sector, where the following companies experienced the top percentages: Barclays Plc ( BCS ) at 99.5 percent, Blackrock Inc. ( BLK ) at 99.6 percent, Goldman Sachs Group ( GS) at 99.01 percent and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) at 99.5 percent, to name a few. Fisher even reduced in exchange traded funds such as the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund ( FXI ) and the MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan Index Fund ( AAXJ ).\nAdditionally, Fisher sold all of his shares of more than 50 companies, a majority experiencing an average of 10 percent price increase while some declined in price of at least 10 percent. Among these companies, WindGen Energy ( WGEI ) experienced the lowest change from average price at 50 percent and financial services company, CPC of America Inc. ( CPCF ) doesn't trail too far back at 23 percent down from its average price.\nAmidst his list of sells, Fisher also introduced about 58 stocks to his portfolio and added to his shareholding of 57 companies. (Read more about some of Fisher's latest Q3 purchases on Ken Fisher's Top Mega-Cap New Purchases.)\nFisher's recent reductions are reflective of his current portfolio composition, holding a majority of his shares in the technology and financial sectors.\nSeveral of Fisher's sell decisions in the third quarter truly highlighted his value investment strategy.\nBarclays (BCS)\nFisher reduced by 99.5 percent of his stake of global financial services provider, Barclays Plc. Out of all of Fisher's third-quarter reductions, the company experienced the most increase from its average price, at 33 percent. From more than 16 million shares in Q2, Fisher sold 15,997,785 shares, bringing him to his current holding of 80,006.\nRecently, Barclays announced that it experienced higher levels of Payment Protection Insurance claims since the end of the first half of 2012, and predicts its profits before tax in the third quarter to be broadly in line with the current market consensus of ?1.7 billion, according to Barclays' website.\nIn September, the opening of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, unveiled a facility made home to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets, offering about 18,000 seats for basketball games and up to 19,000 seats for concerts.\nBarclays is currently selling at $14.93 per share, with a market cap of $46.57 billion, a P\/E(ttm) ratio of 12.3 and a P\/S ratio of 0.9.\nFreeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)\nReducing his Freeman shareholding by 99.3 percent in the third quarter, Fisher currently holds 92,671 shares compared to more than 14 million in the end of the second quarter. Its market price jumped 19 percent at the time of the transaction.\nArizona-based Freeman-McMoRan is an international mining company that produces copper, gold and molybdenum, and owns assets including a mining complex in Indonesia and operations in South America and Democratic Republic of Congo.\nFor the first six months of this year, Freeman reported a net income of $1.5 billion, attributable to common stock at $1.55 per share, much lower compared to the $2.9 billion of net income reported in last year's six months, attributable to common stock at $3.00 per share.\nIn September, the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3125 per share, payable to its holders this November.\nFreeman is currently trading at $41.50, with a market cap of $38.1 billion. Its P\/E (ttm) ratio is close to its one-year high of 12.1; its P\/B ratio is 1.9 and its P\/S ratio is 1.8.\nCheck Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP)\nFisher reduced his holding of Check Point Software Technologies by 91.6 percent in the third quarter. He added the stock to his portfolio in the second quarter of this year, originally starting with more than 1.2 million shares. He now has 102,000 shares after selling about 1.11 million shares.\nCheck Point experienced the largest decrease from the average price compared to the rest of Fisher's reductions in the third quarter upon the time of the transaction. In total, the change from the average price was 15 percent.\nAs the company that introduced FireWall-1 to the tech industry, Check Point is a company that produces software which aids in securing Internet security, including hacker-, spyware- and identity theft protection. It had a total revenue of $332.4 million in the third quarter, according to its quarter-end filings, representing an 8 percent increase compared to the prior year. Its earnings per share for the third quarter also increased, this time by 10 percent, at $0.79 per share.\nCheck Point currently sells at $41.25 per share which has surpassed its one year low of $44.30. It has a market cap of $9.43 billion; its P\/E (ttm) ratio is 16.3, which is close to its three-year low.

( TXN ) is scheduled to announce its third-quarter fiscal 2012 results on October 22, 2012, and we notice upward as well as downward movements in analyst estimates.\nPrior-Quarter Synopsis\nTexas Instrumentsdelivered a decent second quarter with pro forma earnings per share of 46 cents, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.\nThe company reported revenue of $3.34 billion, up 6.9% sequentially and toward the middle of the revised guidance range of $3.22-$3.48 billion. The strength in the quarter came from growth in core analog, led by power management and HVAL.\nGross margin was 49.5%, down 22 basis points (bps) sequentially, impacted by lower insurance proceeds. It also declined 199 bps from the year-ago quarter, mainly on account of low utilization rates as well as lower revenue.\nThird-Quarter Guidance\nRecently, the company narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the third quarter of 2012.\nThe chipmaker now expects sales of $3.27-$3.41 billion versus its previous guidance of $3.21-$3.47 billion. The earnings outlook range has also been raised to 38-42 cents per share from the previous guidance of 34-42 cents.\n(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Guidance Pulls Down TI Shares\nAgreement of Analysts\nOver the last 30 days, only 1 out of the 30 analysts providing estimates made an upward revision, while none made downward revisions for the third quarter. For fiscal 2012, 8 out of 21 analysts made downward revisions, with none of the estimates moving in the opposite direction.\nRecently, management revised its revenue and earnings guidance for the third quarter but did not reduce the midpoint of the guidance, allaying investor concerns. Analysts, by and large, expect results to come in line with the revised guidance.\nThe company stated that insurance receipts of $60 million related to the 2011 earthquake in Japan and various restructuring activities will likely help earnings in the upcoming quarter.\nHowever, a few analysts expect revenue and earnings to come in below the guidance range. They continue to believe that the ongoing macro weakness and strong competition from tablets and smartphones will likely hit TI's computing market. The analysts also contend that a slowdown in Europeand mature markets could be an added concern.\nRecent reports from Israeli newspaper Calcalist stated that Amazon (AMZN) was in advanced talks to buy TI's OMAP business. The majority of analysts see this as a clear positive for TI as it would remove a major investor overhang. They believe that the sale would bring in a lot of cash, which will allow management to reduce its huge debt balance, currently estimated to be $4.2 billion.\nLonger term, majority of the analysts contend that TI's analog and embedded businesses will continue to drive growth. They see potential margin expansion opportunities from the company's cost cutting initiatives along with growth in higher-margin businesses. Additionally, the analysts contend that 300mm RFABand cost synergies from the NSMacquisition will likely lead to margins and earnings upside going forward.\nMagnitude of Estimate Revisions\nIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 45 cents for the third quarter, but was down 2 cents to $1.66 for fiscal 2012.\nOver the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate was down by 3 cents for the third quarter and by 8 cents for fiscal 2012.\nRecommendation\nThough we remain optimistic about Texas Instruments' compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and its lower-cost 300mm capacity, we expect the company to report in-line third quarter results due to a weak PC market worldwide and a challenging global economy.\nThough the wireless segment has been struggling for a while, TI recently announced that it was seeing some improvement owing to new tablet launches that use the company's ARM-based OMAP processors. Also, its new analog and embedded processing designs getting into volume production should help the gross margin to move up toward its long-term target of 55%.\nOn the cost front, we believe the company has taken a number of steps in 2011 by closing a couple of 6-inch facilities in Hiji, Japanand Houston, Texasand transitioning the remaining products to more advanced facilities. The restructuring is expected to generate annual savings of $100 million a year.\nHowever, we remain concerned about the macro weakness, Texas Instruments' larger exposure to wireless communications infrastructure, and National's huge debt balance, which has negatively impacted the balance sheet.\nIncreasing competition from Maxim Integrated Products ( MXIM ), Analog Devices ( ADI ), Broadcom ( BRCM ) and Intel ( INTC ) is also a matter of concern.\nWe, therefore, have a short-term Hold rating (Zacks #3 Rank) on Texas Instruments shares.\nANALOG DEVICES (ADI): Free Stock Analysis Report\nBROADCOM CORP-A (BRCM): Free Stock Analysis Report\nINTEL CORP (INTC): Free Stock Analysis Report\nMAXIM INTG PDTS (MXIM): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTEXAS INSTRS (TXN): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\nZacks Investment Research\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"What Is The Ownership Structure Like For ATA Creativity Global (NASDAQ:AACG)?"}

According to the company, Ampyra is the first and only product approved for the improvement of walking in multiple sclerosis patients. Ampyra is the key growth driver at Acorda. The company expects net Ampyra revenue in the range of $255 million to $275 million in 2012. Ampyra has the potential to be approved for additional indications as well. Acorda is currently studying Ampyra in phase II proof-of-concept studies for cerebral palsy (results by year end) and post-stroke deficits (results in early 2013).\nWe are positive on Acorda's June 2009 agreement with Biogen Idec ( BIIB ) for the development and commercialization of Fampyra (ex-US trade name of Ampyra) in ex-US markets. In addition to receiving an upfront payment of $110 million, Acorda is entitled to receive milestone payments as well as double-digit tiered royalties. Given Biogen's expertise and strong presence in the multiple sclerosis market, we believe Biogen is a suitable partner for Acorda.\nWhile we are pleased with the approval of Ampyra, we remain concerned about the company's dependence on the product for growth. Zanaflex, another marketed product in Acorda's portfolio, is facing generic competition and will remain a negligible contributor to sales. Moreover, Ampyra sales have not really lived up to expectations. Sales were disappointing in the first quarter of 2012. Although performance improved in the second quarter of 2012, it remains to be seen whether the same is sustainable. Unfavorable reimbursement and pricing issues in the EU could also affect Fampyra royalties.\nBesides being concerned about the company's over-dependence on Ampyra, we remain concerned about the early-stage nature of the pipeline. Although the company has some interesting candidates in its pipeline, it will be several years before any of these candidates are close to commercialization.\nWe prefer to remain on the sidelines until we see a sustained improvement in Ampyra sales.

Yet they go a step further and contend that JP Morgan Chase ( JPM ) should assume Alcoa's place of prominence. Try again!\nWhile JP Morgan has a broader reach into our economy, it's still just one company. And reading too much into a single company's report is asking for trouble.\nThere's just no way that doing so can accurately predict the outcome for thousands of other companies. Period.\nAccordingly, I don't recommend wasting any more time hunting for such a \"Holy Grail\" stock. Instead, we should focus on three key metrics that really matter this reporting season.\nBut before I get to them, let me provide a little context…\nExpectations: From Bad to Worse… and Still Irrelevant\nNo doubt about it: This earnings reporting season, which kicks into high gear next week when 732 companies are scheduled to report, promises to be one of the ugliest in recent memory.\nOn a whole, S&P 500 companies are expected to report a 2.6% drop in profits. If actual results match that projection, it would end the growth streak we've seen the past 11 quarters in a row.\nFor months now, analysts and companies alike have been preparing us for this inevitability, as well. I wouldn't read too much into the negativity, though.\nAs Dan Greenhaus, Chief Global Strategist at BTIG, says, \"Earnings guidance is a game that everybody plays and nobody acknowledges.\"\nIn other words, companies' overly downbeat projections could be setting the stage for a classic relief rally, as actual results (surprise) come in ahead of expectations.\nEven if corporate profits do fall this quarter, though, we need to put them into perspective.\nAfter all, the S&P 500 is still on pace for its third-highest earnings-per-share payout in history of $25. The second-highest total came in the third quarter of 2011, which makes year-over-year comparisons for this quarter tough. We'd basically need to hit an all-time high in profitability, which just isn't reasonable to expect.\nSo instead of obsessing about the year-over-year earnings growth rate, we should be focusing on these three metrics.\n~ Key Statistic #1: Earnings \"Beat Rate\"\nAs long as companies are producing more and more profits, stock prices are likely to charge higher.\nAnd to quickly gauge whether or not the stock market should head higher based on earnings, all we have to do is monitor the earnings \"beat rate.\" That is, the percentage of companies beating analysts' expectations for profits.\nThe bar's set low from last quarter, too. Only 58.7% of companies beat earnings expectations, which is the lowest reading since the bull market began, according to Bespoke Investment Group. So any reading above 60% should propel stock prices higher.\n~ Key Statistic #2: Revenue \"Beat Rate\"\nCompanies are finding fewer places to cut costs to boost earnings. That means they'll be forced to boost profitability the old fashioned way - by increasing sales.\nAgain, expectations are low heading into this quarter. Based on estimates from FactSet, third-quarter revenue is supposed to be flat. (At the beginning of the quarter, analysts originally expected sales to grow about 2%. Blame Europe for the reversal.)\nProjections mean squat, though. What we want to track are the actual sales results. They represent the clearest sign that demand for goods and services is increasing - or at least hanging tight - in the face of the European slowdown.\nHere, too, we don't need to worry about reviewing every last company report. We just need to track the revenue \"beat rate,\" or the percentage of companies beating analysts' expectations for sales.\nLike the earnings beat rate, the revenue beat rate came in last quarter at the lowest level since the bull market began, at 48.4%. Any reading above the long-term average of 61.8% should prove to be another catalyst for higher stock prices.\n~ Key Statistic #3: Guidance Spread\nSince the stock market is a forward-looking beast, past results don't matter as much as expectations for the future. And, obviously, the market could use a healthy dose of optimism right now.\nThe easy way to get a pulse on expectations for the future is to track the guidance spread. That is, the difference between the percentage of companies raising guidance and the percentage of companies lowering guidance.\nSimply put, a positive spread indicates that more companies are optimistic about the future. And a negative spread indicates that more companies are pessimistic.\nAs a frame of reference, the guidance spread has been negative for the last four quarters. Before that, it was positive for nine quarters in a row.\nThe end result? Any positive reading this quarter will go a long way to push stock prices higher.\nBottom line: Even after a weaker-than-average second-quarter reporting season, stocks managed to rally 6.5%, as investors had already priced in the worst news. I'm convinced the same is going to happen in the third quarter. With the bar set so low - along with the tendency for stocks to rise in the fourth quarter of a presidential election year - the market's poised to rally into the end of the year.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"Tuesday Sector Leaders: Education & Training Services, Electric Utilities"}

( GPS ), in the process of achieving superior long-term growth has created a new business structure that places the global operations of its brands under one executive. With this strategy of uniting its operations, the company expects to speed up its ability to swiftly respond to the evolving consumer needs, while expanding its world-wide presence and boosting shareholder value.\nGap announced that with the commencement of fiscal 2013, its North American, international, online, outlet and franchise divisions will be spearheaded by a single global executive for each of its brands - Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy. Additionally, the company aims at bolstering its online presence as well as making technological advancements with the creation of a new Innovation and Digital Strategy team.\nTo facilitate this transition, the company made a few alterations in the existing management positions, which will be effective November 5 onwards. The company has promoted the president of Gap's international division, Steve Sunnucks, to the position of the Global President, overlooking operations from New York. Assisting Sunnucks from San Francisco, Mark Breitbard, the senior product leader for the brand in the U.S. and Canada, will now be appointed as the President of Gap North America.\nArt Peck, the current president of Gap North America, has been elevated to the position of President of the new innovation, digital strategy and new brands division.\nAt Banana Republic, Jack Calhoun, will assume his new role as the Global President and will focus on all channels and markets globally. He currently serves as the division's president. At Old Navy, the company made an early start with this strategy, appointing Stefan Larsson as the Global President in April. He has assumed the new role starting this month.\nAdditionally, management indicated that it sees China operations as a major long term opportunity for its brands. Hence, the company has placed the China division under the direct supervision of Chairman and CEO, Glenn Murphy.\nNancy Green, presently working as the product leader for Old Navy, has been given the new role of supporting China operations. In her new role, she is empowered to channel the product assortment and merchandise for the China market.\nFurther, management stated that the current president of its online division, Toby Lenk, will be leaving the company following the transition in February 2013.\nThese changes are the result of the management shifts made in 2011 that targeted uniting the specialty and outlet divisions and also setting up the Gap Global Creative Center in New York.\nOver the years, Gap's five brands and more than 3,200 stores have spanned across over 40 countries globally, expanding significantly compared to operating in only eight countries in 2006. The company mainly competes with national and local department stores and discount stores, such as, American Eagle Outfitters Inc. ( AEO ) and The TJX Companies Inc. ( TJX ), which offer products at fire sale prices.\nGap currently maintains a Zacks #1 Rank, which translates into a short-term Strong Buy rating.

With that, the market meandered for much of the session before closing slightly higher across most of the indices.\nAs far as the earnings highlights go, financial plays M&T Bank ( MTB ) and Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ) gained ground on the back of solid numbers. On the flip side, investors were not as pleased with the earnings results from companies such as IBM Corp ( IBM ), Intel Corp ( INTC ), Stanley Black & Decker ( SWK ), and Abbott Labs ( ABT ). We had a split analyst call move shares in the REIT (real estate investment trust) space, with a Wall Street firm preferring shares of Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO ) over Simon Property Group ( SPG ).\nFor all the recent dividend stock earnings reports and much more, be sure to check out The Dividend Daily .\nWrong Person for the Job\nYesterday was a big day for fans of the Philadelphia Eagles football team, which decided to shake things up mid-season, firing their defensive coordinator Juan Castillo. On the surface, it sounds like just any ordinary firing. If you dig deeper and follow sports like I do, you will soon see the team made a tremendous blunder in putting Castillo in the position he was in to begin with.\nYou see, Castillo was asked to become the team's defensive coordinator in 2011 when the Eagles' first choice for the job turned them down. With little options remaining, the team decided to put Castillo in charge of its defense instead. That move turned a lot of heads at the time, since Castillo had little experience coaching on the defensive side of the ball. He'd been the team's offensive line coach for over a decade, and last coached on defense more than 20 years ago for a college team. Indeed, he'd never done any defensive coaching at the pro level at all. So what exactly was the organization expecting?\nYou'd be surprised how often individuals make similar decisions when it comes to money-related matters, whether it is bad investment ideas, mediocre career choices leading to unambitious work, listening to unreliable information on buying a business they have little to no experience being in, and so on. It doesn't matter your social or financial status, a bad decision will ultimately lead to poor results.\nFailure can be a good thing, of course, as long as we learn from it. Plus, there's a big difference at trying and failing at something you have a legitimate shot at succeeding in, versus putting yourself (or in the Eagles' case, someone else) in a position they're totally unqualified for. These sorts of errors, which should be obviously wrong from the beginning, are simply unacceptable.\nPositioning for the Election Outcome\nWe have lots of investors currently trying to jockey their portfolios for who they believe could win this year's November presidential election. Some may guess right while others some may guess wrong when it comes to their trades, and how the markets will react. For short-term traders, this is what they live and eventually die for. For longer-term investors, making short-sighted moves just because of which candidate did better in a debate is not the way you ever want to approach your money decisions. The race is too tight for anyone to feel they can make a big score. All we know is there will be some sort of fallout, and with that, opportunities could arise. As always, we'll do our best to interpret the events as they unfold.\nAn Important Note Regarding the Best Dividend Stocks List\nWe want to make sure everyone understands that the stocks on our Best Dividend Stocks List are the names we currently like for new investor capital, regardless of what date the stock was first recommended on.

The automotive replacement parts distributor posted a profit of $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2012, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. For the upcoming quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company is $1.12 per share, reflecting an annualized estimated growth of 15.5%.\nWith respect to earnings surprise, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and met the same in the other. It has delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.6%, implying that it has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by the same magnitude.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimates for full-year 2012 is $4.06, implying an estimated year-over-year growth of 13.4%. The upside potential of the third quarter and full year estimates, essentially a proxy for future earnings surprises, would be about -0.89% and -0.25%, respectively.\nSecond Quarter Review\nGenuine Parts reported an 11.1% rise in profits to $168.6 million in the quarter from $151.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share increased 12.5% to $1.08 from 96 cents in the comparable quarter of 2011 and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nRevenues in the quarter grew 4.8% to $3.3 billion, slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.4 billion. Operating profit also increased 4.5% to $705.0 million from $674.6 million a year ago, despite a 4% rise in selling, general and administrative expenses to $680.2 million during the quarter.\nGenuine Parts has undertaken various initiatives to boost sales and earnings, such as product line expansion, penetration into new markets and cost-saving activities. The company relies on a diverse product portfolio for top-line and bottom-line growth.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nEstimates for the third quarter have remained almost stable over the past 60 days.\nAgreement of Estimate Revisions\nOver the last 30 days, none of the six analysts covering the stock have revised the estimates upward while one analyst moved it downward. Over the last 7 days, none of the analysts revised the estimates for the quarter, implying the lack of near-term catalysts for the stock. Estimates for 2012 depict the same trend..\nMagnitude of Estimate Revisions\nFollowing the second quarter earnings release, estimates for the third quarter and full year have decreased by a penny to $1.12 and $4.06, respectively.\nOur Take\nBased in Atlanta, Georgia Genuine Parts distributes automotive and industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical\/electronic materials in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Its major competitors include Advance Auto Parts ( AAP ) and AutoZone Inc. ( AZO ).\nGenuine Parts is likely to see higher sales and earnings due to its product line expansion, penetration into new markets and cost-saving activities. The company relies on a diverse product portfolio for top-line and bottom-line growth. In addition, rising demand in the Automotive Parts segment due to increase in average age of vehicles on the road to almost 11 years will enhance the company's profitability.\nCurrently, Genuine Parts retains a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term (1 to 3 months) Sell rating and we have a long-term (more than 6 months) Neutral recommendation on the stock.\nADVANCE AUTO PT (AAP): Free Stock Analysis Report\nAUTOZONE INC (AZO): Free Stock Analysis Report\nGENUINE PARTS (GPC): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\nZacks Investment Research\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"Asian ADRs Move Lower in Monday Trading"}

On the whole, earnings were disappointing, especially from big tech concerns like IBM,\" said Schaeffer's Senior Technical Strategist Ryan Detrick. \"But on the other hand, housing starts for September were the strongest in more than four years! I've said this many times before, but the multiple that improving housing data will do for confidence is exponential versus anything the Fed can do by pumping liquidity into the system.\"\nIs a continued upswing in the works for the housing sector? Here are two critical levels to watch , courtesy of the Schaeffer's trading team.\nSee why Fossil, Inc. ( FOSL ) could be a potential target for contrarians .\nAnd now, a look at the numbers...\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJI - 13,557.00)International Business Machines Corp.'s ( IBM )AA\nThe S&P 500 Index (SPX - 1,460.91) and Nasdaq Composite (COMP - 3,104.12) didn't stray too far from breakeven, but followed the Dow into positive territory. The SPX tacked on 6 points, or 0.4%, while the COMP added 3 points, or 0.1%.\nThe CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX - 15.07) edged 0.2 point, or nearly 1%, lower today, marking a second day below its 20-day moving average.\nToday's highlight : \"We've been bullish on housing names all year, so you have to like the fact that although the market was pretty much flat, housing names kicked butt once again,\" smiled Detrick. \"All in all, the stage is still set for a strong fourth-quarter rally, and it very well might be led by housing.\"\nNoteworthy stats at the close:\nThe equity put\/call volume ratio across all 10 options exchanges arrived at 0.77, with 8.4 million calls traded today, compared to roughly 6.5 million puts.\nThe put\/call volume ratio on the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (NYSEARCA:VXX - 32.98) -- which tagged a new split-adjusted record low of 32.78 -- checked in at 1.30, with puts outnumbering calls.\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) showed an advance\/decline ratio of 2.28, signaling the number of upward movers outpaced the decliners by a margin of more than two to one. Meanwhile, the advance\/decline ratio of 1.60 on the Nasdaq confirmed that the number of upward movers trumped the decliners.\nCheck our Trading Floor Blog and Daily Options Blog for today's big stories, including:\nTechnical analysis and a look ahead for Citigroup Inc.

( ADI ). The largest additions to the 10 holdings he increased are: Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. ( IPG ), American International Group Inc. ( AIG ) and Oracle Corp. ( ORCL ).\nRomick's diversified, risk-averse FPA Crescent Fund gained almost 20% over the 12 months ending June 30, 2012. He continues to employ his bottom-up value strategy of buying cheap, typically out-of-favor assets at discounts that would prevent permanent impairment of capital, which he discusses in his October GuruFocus interview .\n\"The fact that we feel that we cannot lose money over a period of time is a margin of safety. You can't just look at margin of safety as being a discount to an asset value,\" he said in the interview.\nAnalog Devices Inc. ( ADI )\nRomick purchased 3.47 million shares of Analog Devices at an average price of $39. The new holding accounts for 2.2% of his portfolio.\nAnalog Devices designs, manufactures and analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs) that measure and convert information such as temperature and light into digital data. Such devices are found in the majority of electronic equipment in the industrial, automotive, communications and consumer markets. Analysts estimate that its converter (44% of its business) market share ranges between 40% and 48.5%, according to Gartner and Databeans.\nAnalog Devices' stock has declined 1.33% since it transferred to Nasdaq on April 4. Romick tends to seek stocks in out-of-favor industries, and semiconductor stocks have declined 11% year to date, compared to a 12.7% gain for the S&P 500.\nAnalog Devices grew EBITDA per share at a 10.6% annual rate over the last five years and free cash flow at 8.2%. Its 2011 free cash flow declined to $778 million from $880 million in 2010. From 2007 to 2011, it has returned more than 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.\nAnalog Devices has an $11.39 billion market cap and traded on Monday for $38.55 with a P\/E ratio of 17.7 and P\/S ratio of 3.8. The dividend yield of Analog Devices stocks is 3.2%. GuruFocus rated Analog Devices the business predictability rank of 4-star .\nInterpublic Group of Companies Inc. ( IPG )\nRomick purchased 2,658,200 shares of Interpublic Group at an average price of $11, bringing his total holding to 7,080,000 shares.\nInterpublic is one of the world's largest advertising and marketing services conglomerates, operating in over 100 countries. Its stock has gained almost 18% year to date.\nInterpublic's EBITDA grew at a five-year rate of 9.5% and revenue at 0.4%. Free cash flow declined to $133 million in 2011 from $721 million in 2010, and has been positive annually since 2007. In the first half of 2012, the company repurchased 11 million common shares at an average price of $11.\nJohn Rogers, head of Ariel Investments, commented on Interpublic in his second-quarter letter:\n\"... When confronted with economic challenges, companies can and often do quickly scale back marketing and advertising to save money. And yet, IPG not only grew but was able to show margin expansion over the last four years-a period when tepid economic growth was a headwind. All the while, the company also managed to buy back half a billion dollars of dilutive convertible debt. In so doing, Debt\/EBITDA substantially improved from 2.81x to 1.92x, which ultimately provided the company access to more favorable debt markets. This level of debt reduction, along with the company's repurchase of 52 million shares, has cut its diluted share count from 553 million to 438 million shares-a 20% decrease in shares outstanding. It is worth noting that even after this hefty $700 million spend, the company still had the ability to issue its first dividend in nearly a decade.\"\nInterpublic has a $4.92 billion market cap. Its shares on Monday traded around $11.45 with a P\/E ratio of 14.6 and P\/S ratio of 0.7. Interpublic's dividend yield is 2.1%.\nAmerican International Group Inc. ( AIG )\nRomick in the third quarter added 680,500 AIG shares at an average price of $33, raising his total holding, which he initiated last quarter, to 4,320,500 shares. AIG have rallied almost 58% year to date.\nAIG is the insurance giant rescued by government bailouts early in the 2008 financial crisis. The insurer that year reported a $99.3 billion loss, though it has increased net income each subsequent year, most recently reporting $16 billion in 2011. After reporting revenue of $11 billion in 2008, revenue fell annually from $96 billion in 2009 to $64 billion in 2011. Free cash flow fell in tandem, from $18 billion in 2009 to $35 million in 2011.\nThough some investors leapt on AIG shares close to when they plummeted from the fiscal crisis - such as Bruce Berkowitz who bought in each 2010 quarter and doubled down in the second quarter of 2011 - other Gurus waited for AIG to get more on its feet. Eleven Gurus initiated AIG positions in the first half of 2012, of which six initiated in the second quarter, including Third Point's Daniel Loeb, who discussed the purchase at length in his third-quarter letter:\n\"Longer term, we believe the company's operational turnaround will help AIG realize its intrinsic value, as Chartis, AIG's property and casualty arm, improves its return on equity to the targeted 10 - 12% by 2015,\" Loeb wrote.\nAIG on Tuesday trades for $36.65, about two-thirds of its $58.82 second-quarter book value. It has a market cap of $57.8 billion, a P\/E ratio of 18.4 and P\/S ratio of 1.\nOracle Corp. ( ORCL )\nRomick bought 695,000 shares of Oracle at an average price of $31, bringing his total holding to 5,155,000 shares. Oracle has a 52-week range of $24.91 to $33.81.\nOracle, an enterprise software and computer hardware products and services company that services every Fortune 100 company, has seen its stock increase 22% year to date. The company has an 18.2% five-year annual EBITDA growth rate, and 18.2% free cash flow rate. It has also achieved 10 straight years of net income growth. In 2011, it generated a decade-high $13.1 billion of free cash flow, increased from $10.9 billion in 2010.\nOracle has been aggressively repurchasing shares. In its first fiscal quarter 2013 (ended Aug. 31, 2012) it bought back 104.2 million shares for $3.1 billion, after spending almost $6 billion on buybacks in the full-year 2012.\nIn its first fiscal quarter, Oracle's revenues declined 2% year over year, with 19% declines in hardware systems revenues, and 4% increase in software (including new software licenses, cloud software subscriptions, software license updates and product support) revenues.\nOracle President Mark Hurd expects double engineered system sales and its new cloud business to drive the company's growth in upcoming years, he said in the first-quarter press release. The company expects double engineered systems sales to exceed $1 billion in the next year, and the cloud business is nearing a $1 billion annual run rate.\nOracle Corporation has a $151.36 billion market cap. Its shares were traded at around $31.29 with a P\/E ratio of 13, P\/S ratio of 4.1 and dividend yield of 0.8%. GuruFocus rated Oracle the business predictability rank of 5-star.\nSee Steven Romick's portfolio here.

Furthermore, this Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) has a solid dividend yield of 2.30% after the customary dividend hike to $1.62 per share.\nAccenture Reports Fourth Quarter\nOn September 27, 2012, Accenture reported fourth quarter earnings of 88 cents per share, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue increased 2.2% year over year to $6.84 billion, supported by growth in the Financial Services and Health & Public Services segments, partially offset by lackluster growth in the Communications, Media & Technology segment.\nDuring the quarter, solid growth in Outsourcing revenue mitigated the shortfall in Consulting revenue. Geographically, Asia-Pacific and the Americas performed well.\nPositive Outlook for First Quarter & Fiscal 2013\nAfter considering a 3.0% negative foreign-exchange impact, Accenture expects net revenue between $7.1 billion and $7.35 billion for its fiscal first quarter, reflecting a 3.8%-7.5% sequential increase. The company did not provide a first quarter update on earnings per share.\nFor fiscal 2013, management expects net revenue to grow 5.0% to 8.0%. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) are expected between $4.22 and $4.30, compared to $3.84 recorded in fiscal 2012.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate rose over the last 30 days on the basis of the positive earnings guidance. Specifically, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2013 increased 3.4% to $4.27 per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2014 advanced 2.6% to $4.67.\nDividend\nAccenture's dividend yield of 2.30% is noteworthy. The company has been paying a dividend since October 2005. During the quarter, Accenture paid a semiannual dividend of 81 cents per share, reflecting a 20.0% increase over the prior semiannual payout of 67.5 cents. The current payout indicates a 170.0% increase over the 30 cents paid in October 2005.\nValuation\nAccenture shares are currently trading at 16.2X forward earnings, a discount of 7.8% to the industry average of 17.6X. Accenture trades at a PEG ratio of 1.4, which is higher than the industry average of 1.3. Keeping in view the company's earnings growth potential and solid dividend yield, we believe that the valuation is justified.\nAccenture provides management consulting, technology services and outsourcing services to each industrial sector across the world. With about 257,000 employees globally, the company delivers a wide range of consulting, technology and outsourcing services to its clients in industries such as communications, high tech, financial services, public service, products and resources. Accenture has extensive relationships with the world's leading companies and governments and operates in over 120 countries. It seeks to deliver value to its clients by leveraging its industry knowledge, global delivery capability and technology expertise.

The positive tone helped benchmarks to rebound from its previous week's losses and guided Dow to register its biggest gain in one month. Financial sectors and health care sectors were the major gainers yesterday. However, investors remained watchful about Spain's bailout.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.7% to close the day at 13,424.23. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) climbed 0.8% to finish yesterday's trading session at 1,440.13. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index surged 0.7% to end at 3,064.18. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down by 5.4% to settle at 15.27. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were roughly 5.9 billion shares, slightly lower than year-on-year daily average of 6.52 billion shares. The advancing stocks outran the declining stocks on the NYSE in the ratio 2 to 1.\nThe Street enjoyed a bullish sentiment from the very beginning of the trading session banking on a couple of positive news. The U.S. Census Bureau released its retail sales data, which revealed that the retail sales rose 1.1% to $412.9 billion in September, beating the consensus estimates of 0.8%. According to the government, the retail sales gains in August and September were the largest ones since October 2010. Separately, Retail trade sales gained 1.2% from August and 5.3% from year-ago period. The nonstore retail sales jumped 15.0% from September 2011.\nThe rise in retail sales helped the Consumer Discretionary SPDR to climb 1.0% yesterday. Stocks such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ), PriceSmart, Inc. (NASDAQ: PSMT ), Sears Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: SHLD ), Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT ) and Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE: BIG ) rose 1.8%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.5% and 2.6%, respectively.\nMeanwhile, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C ), the third-largest U.S. bank, reported its third-quarter earnings results beating the analysts' estimates. Citigroup's shares surged 5.5% following the announcement of the earnings results; the biggest advance since March. The company's results were boosted by $582 million tax benefit, increase in bond-trading revenue and surge in mortgage lending. The other two financial bellwethers, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM ) and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ), had also reported better-than-expected results last Friday.\nFinancial Select Sector SPDR surged 1.1% after the encouraging result. Financial stocks such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ), JPM, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS ) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ) surged 2.5%, 1.8%, 3.6% and 3.5%, respectively.\nComing to the healthcare sector, it enjoyed decent gains and remained the top performer in S&P 500. Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: LLY ) gained 4.1% following the news that its potential stomach cancer treatment had achieved the goal for improving the patient survival. Whereas, Abbott Laboratories's (NYSE: ABT ) experimental hepatitis C candidate showed positive signs. The news pushed shares of Abbott Laboratories up by 4.0%. Stocks such as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK ) and Bristol Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY ) gained 1.8%, 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively.\nOn the international front, investors remained watchful about developments related to Spain's bailout. According to a Euro-zone official, Spain could ask for bailout next month. On the other hand, China's rate of inflation has come down to 1.9% in September from 2.0% the month before.\nABBOTT LABS (ABT): Free Stock Analysis Report\nBANK OF AMER CP (BAC): Free Stock Analysis Report\nBIG LOTS INC (BIG): Free Stock Analysis Report\nBRISTOL-MYERS (BMY): Free Stock Analysis Report\nCITIGROUP INC (C): Free Stock Analysis Report\nGOLDMAN SACHS (GS): Free Stock Analysis Report\nJPMORGAN CHASE (JPM): Free Stock Analysis Report\nLILLY ELI & CO (LLY): Free Stock Analysis Report\nMERCK & CO INC (MRK): Free Stock Analysis Report\nMORGAN STANLEY (MS): Free Stock Analysis Report\nPFIZER INC (PFE): Free Stock Analysis Report\nPRICESMART INC (PSMT): Free Stock Analysis Report\nSEARS HLDG CP (SHLD): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTARGET CORP (TGT): Free Stock Analysis Report\nWELLS FARGO-NEW (WFC): Free Stock Analysis Report\nWAL-MART STORES (WMT): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\nZacks Investment Research\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"Thursday Sector Laggards: Education & Training Services, Home Furnishings & Improvement Stocks"}

{"Date":"2019-01-16","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/asian-adrs-move-higher-wednesday-trading-2019-01-16","Article":"Submitted by Wall St. Daily as part of our contributors program .\nLast week, Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) officially kicked-off third-quarter earnings reporting season.\nI've always shunned reading too much into a single company's report, particularly Alcoa's. Now I have all the hard evidence I need to back me up.\nIn honor of Myth-Busting Mondays, let me first prove to you why the aluminum giant's earnings mean - in the emphatic lyrics of Edwin Starr - \"Absolutely nothing!\"\nThen in my next column, I'll share the three statistics that really matter this earnings reporting season.\nLet's get to it…\nOld Traditions Die Hard\nIt's been a long-standing tradition on Wall Street to treat Alcoa's results as a barometer for the health of the global economy. And, more importantly, as a leading indicator of what to expect when the rest of corporate America reports results.\nPart of that tradition can be attributed to the fact that Alcoa's the first company in the Dow 30 to report results - and that its products are traditionally vital to the economy.\nSimply put, old traditions die hard. But it's time to euthanize this one.\nWhy? Because as Art Hogan, Market Strategist at Lazard Capital Markets, points out, manufacturing accounts for only about 15% of the U.S. economy. Plus, very little aluminum goes into manufacturing outside the construction and auto industries.\nTranslation: As manufacturing's contribution to the U.S. economy keeps shrinking, Alcoa's significance does, too. Or as Standard & Poor's Howard Silverblatt, says, \"Materials is an important sector, but it's very small and not very indicative.\"\nAccordingly, trying to use Alcoa's results alone to predict the outcome for a service-dominated economy makes little to no sense anymore.\nThe latest data proves it, too…\nSince 2009, when Alcoa missed earnings estimates, 72.4% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index actually beat estimates, according to FactSet data. So much for predicting the fate of corporate America.\nWhat about Alcoa's ability to forcast the direction of the stock market, though? Again, the connection is weak, at best.\nFifteen out of the 19 times that Alcoa beat expectations over the last 10 years, the S&P 500 Index increased in value over the next three months.\nHowever, when Alcoa missed expectations over the same period, which is supposed to be an ominous sign for the market, the S&P 500 dipped a mere 0.6% over the next three months. (If the prospect of a 0.6% dip in prices scares you, you shouldn't be invested in the stock market. Just saying.)\nAs John Butters, Senior Earnings Analyst at FactSet, says, \"It appears that Alcoa's earnings performance relative to estimates has little predictive value in determining the earnings performance of the remaining companies in the [S&P 500] Index.\"\nBottom line: Consider this yet another myth busted. Alcoa's results hold no more predictive ability than the gizzard squeezers who tried to tell the Roman emperors when the Huns would attack (to paraphrase Peter Lynch).\nSo the fact that Alcoa beat results this quarter is meaningless. What really matters are the three factors I'm going to discuss in my next column on Wednesday. So stay tuned.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"Asian ADRs Move Higher in Wednesday Trading"}
{"Date":"2019-01-08","Url":"https:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/articles\/asian-adrs-move-higher-tuesday-trading-2019-01-08","Article":"Progress Energy Carolinas, a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corporation ( DUK ) has filed for annual base revenue increase of 12% or approximately $387 million with North Carolinas Utilities Commission (\"NCUC\"). The increase is the result of low-emission power generation and higher operating expenses.\nIf the NCUC approves the rates, the rates would increase more for residential customers in comparison to commercial and industrial customers. However, a consequent change in the portion of retail rates that pays for energy-efficiency and demand-side management programs would reduce the revenue request to approximately 11.0% or $359 million per year.\nFor an average residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month, total net increase would be 14.2% to $119.94 from $105.15. This includes an increase in the standard customer charge from $6.75 to $13.50 per month. However, the average net increase for commercial and industrial customers would be approximately 9%.\nCurrent allowed ROE in North Carolina is 12.75% and this request would result in an allowed return on common equity (\"ROE\") of 11.25%. From the date of hearings to the final decision, North Carolina retail rate base is expected to be approximately $6.9 billion. If approved, then the filing requests new rates will be effective from mid-2013.\nOf late, the company had been planning for this revenue increase request. It is neither the consequence of the recent merger nor does it include recovery of employee severance costs associated with the merger. The primary portion of base rate is retail customer rates. The other components are cost of fuel, energy-efficiency programs and renewable energy investments.\nThe main reason for the company to file a rate increase is its investments for the modernization of the power system. Progress Energy Carolinas is retiring and replacing 12 coal-fired units at five sites in the Carolinas with low-emission and natural gas-fueled combined-cycle plants. Over the last 16 months, the company has invested more than $1.3 billion and has brought on-line two gas-fueled plants in Richmond and Wayne counties. One more combined-cycle plant is under construction near Wilmington in North Carolina and is expected to be completed in late 2013.\nThis is the first rate increase filing after 1987. Since then, the company has invested approximately $11 billion in the power systems. Over the last two decades, the company has invested in a number of additional gas-fueled power plants and has made significant investments in the transmission and distribution systems.\nEffective July 2, 2012, Duke Energy had merged with Progress Energy Inc. (\"PGN\"). The recently merged company includes two N.C. utilities, Progress Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Carolinas. However, this request will affect the customers of Progress Energy Carolinas. In 2013, Progress Energy Carolinas is also planning to file a base rate request in South Carolina. Also, Duke Energy Carolinas intends to file general rate cases in both Carolinas in the near term.\nThough the company has filed for rate increase, it keeps itself committed to mitigate the effects of increased electricity costs on its customers with the help of energy-efficiency programs and assistance for low-income customers. Over the last three years, the company has developed more than a dozen new energy-efficiency programs that have helped the customers in saving more than 357 million kWh. This is equal to the annual energy consumption of 25,000 households. The company has also been assisting its customers through payment plan options and Energy Neighbor Fund to mitigate rate increase effects.\nMoreover, this merger would benefit the Carolinas customers by $650 million in guaranteed savings. Moreover, by making the utilities more efficient in day-to-day operations, it would offset the impact of future rate increases.\nCharlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy is a diversified energy company with a portfolio of domestic and international, natural gas and electric, regulated and unregulated businesses, which supply, deliver, and process energy for customers in North America and selected international markets.\nDuke Energy Corporation's U.S. electricity and gas operations spread over the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio generate a relatively stable and growing earnings stream. Going forward, its key growth drivers include its recently concluded merger proceedings with Progress Energy paving the way for the largest U.S. utility. In addition, the company's strong balance sheet, and ongoing capital expansion projects add visibility to the story.\nHowever, we prefer to remain on the sidelines due to the present unfavorable macro backdrop, predominantly fossil-fuel based generation assets, tepid demand for electricity, a sudden change of its CEO and pending regulatory cases. The company presently retains a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) that corresponds with our long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.\nThe company mainly competes with PPL Corporation ( PPL ) and American Electric power Co. Inc. ( AEP ).\nAMER ELEC PWR (AEP): Free Stock Analysis Report\nDUKE ENERGY CP (DUK): Free Stock Analysis Report\nPPL CORP (PPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\nZacks Investment Research\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"Asian ADRs Move Higher in Tuesday Trading"}

The news marks the company's growing focus in one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical markets. Abbott recently entered into a R&D deal in Russia to strengthen its presence in the rapidly growing emerging market.\nOur price estimate for Abbott Labs stands at $67 , a slight discount to the current market price. The stock has appreciated more than 30% in the past year. We recently discussed the company's business model ( read here ) to see what factors could lead to an upside to the Trefis price estimate.\nSee our complete analysis for Abbott Labs\nRussia: A Key Market For Growth\nAbbott's management has oftentimes reiterated its intention to tap the high potential emerging markets as they are expected to grow at a faster pace than developed markets going forward. In the past few years, Abbott has made significant moves to expand its presence and product portfolio in many of the most populous and fastest-growing countries. The company has been building manufacturing facilities in Asia Pacific, including China and India. Russia, however, was off the radar until recently. Abbott's revenue from Russia is a meager $430 million in a market worth more than $16 billion even as most of the drugs sold in the country are from international companies. But, with the recent R&D deal and news of acquisition of Petrovax Pharm's manufacturing facilities in Russia, it seems the company is trying to make inroads into the country.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in Russia has seen double-digit growth rates in the last couple of years to reach nearly $16 billion in 2010. This trend is expected to continue at a higher pace as the Russian government continues to invest money to boost its pharmaceutical market. With the looming patent cliff and dim growth outlook in developed markets, pharmaceutical companies cannot afford to ignore Russia.\nWe believe the acquisition will complement Abbott's global presence and brand. Petrovax Pharm is the twelfth largest local drug manufacturer in Russia. By securing local manufacturing facilities, Abbott is trying to become localized in the Russian market and secure government orders which could reap benefits for the company in the long term.\nRevenue from AndroGel, Synagis and other division was $9 billion in 2007 and soared to $11.5 billion in 2011. We expect these revenues will steadily increase going forward and eventually approach $16 billion by the end of the Trefis forecast period. The 2010 acquisitions of Solvay and Piramal Healthcare position Abbott well to capitalize on growth opportunities in these emerging markets. In 2011, emerging markets accounted for over 25% of the company's total revenue, and we expect this figure to increase going forward.\nWith Petrovax Pharm's present sales of $98 million coupled with price-to-sales multiples of 2-3 (as witnessed in the recent deals), the overall deal could be valued in the range of $190-290 million. While the sum may seem pricey for now should Russia be able to maintain historical double digit growth, in-line with the market expectations, Abbott will be able to recover most of it a short span of time.\nSubmit a Post at Trefis Powered by Data and Interactive Charts| Understand What Drives a Stock at Trefis\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Stock_symbol":"AACG","Article_title":"Asian ADRs Move Higher in Monday Trading"}

The program destroys the hard drives through a compliant recycling process and minimizes the risks of potential fines for improper destruction process.\nConventional hard drive destruction methods are generally time consuming and involve the risks of human error as well as non-compliance with disposal laws. The process, if not compliant with the data confidentiality rules, ends up with serious financial penalties.\nThe penalties include the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that levy fines of up to $250,000 along with a 10-year imprisonment for each violation of patient health information privacy rules, and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that imposes penalties of up to $100,000 per violation by financial institutions.\nMoreover, the discarded hard drives contain information that is confidential and recoverable. Therefore, any loss of sensitive data will have a material impact on the business reputation.\nThe hard drive destruction program provided by Cintas also guarantees that the confidential files are not exposed and are compliant with data privacy standards. Moreover, the customers can view all hard drives to ensure that they are destroyed before the Cintas truck leaves the customers' parking lot.\nBased in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cintas provides specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. The company designs, manufactures, implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products and first aid and safety products.\nCintas' first-quarter fiscal 2013 (ended August 31, 2012) earnings were 60 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Total revenues improved 3.4% year over year to $1.05 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 billion.\nOne of the important raw materials used in Document Management is recycled paper. Gross margin in the second quarter slipped 80 basis points year over year due to lower recycled paper prices. If paper price remains low then it may weigh on the company's revenues going forward. Moreover, Cintas faces tough competition from leading companies like ABM Industries Incorporated ( ABM ) and G&K Services ( GKSR ) and UniFirst Corp.

The contact will also allow a 90-day extension along with public comment process on the new contract, followed by a review by BPA.\nA few days back, Alcoa reported a loss of $143 million or 13 cents in the third quarter of 2012, hurt by a hefty charge associated with environmental remediation and legal settlement, and lower aluminum pricing. It compared with a profit of $172 million or 15 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.\nExcluding one-time special items (a $175 million charge mainly related to environmental remediation of the Grasse River and the settlement of a civil lawsuit against Aluminum Bahrain), Alcoa earned $32 million or 3 cents a share in the quarter compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a break even result on per share basis. The company recorded a $40 million charge associated with the legal settlement in the quarter.\nRevenues decreased 9.1% year over year and 2.2% sequentially to $5,833 million, but were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,565 million. Alcoa said that aluminum prices dropped 17% year over year and 5% sequentially in the third quarter.\nAlcoa witnessed strong productivity growth in its upstream and downstream businesses in the quarter on the back of higher utilization rates, process innovations, lower scrap rates and usage reductions. The company saw healthy demand across the aerospace and automotive markets in the quarter.\nThe company has lowered its global aluminum demand forecast for 2012 to 6% from its earlier expectation of 7%, owing to the slowdown in China. The company, however, expects the aluminum market to double in 2020 from the 2010 levels as the market is already ahead of the required 6.5% compound annual growth rate.\nPennsylvania-based Alcoa Inc. is among the world's leading producers of primary and fabricated aluminum and alumina.

The new system will be implemented soon and will provide Norwegian medical practitioners and patients a fully integrated and updated record of health information.\nAccording to the terms of this agreement, the Norwegian Directorate of Health, along with Accenture will help in deploying a single, national EHR system which will ultimately help medical professionals to organize and view the medical records of patients across Norway. The database will include information related to demographics, clinical history, physician interactions, diagnostic assessments, medications, procedures and patient interaction.\nWe are encouraged by Accenture's recent progress in the healthcare segment, as the new reform measures adopted by the U.S. health department are pushing many healthcare providers toward the electronic health records (EHR) segment.\nThis should have a positive impact on Accenture in the near to medium term and also generate new business opportunities for the company. Other technology companies, such as Hewlett Packard Company ( HPQ ) and Dell Inc. ( DELL ) have also realized the potential in this segment and are coming out with their own solutions to tap the opportunity.\nAgain, the North American market specially provides ample opportunity for growth. Market research firm TechNavio's analysts forecasted that the Electronic Health Record (EHR) market in North America would increase at a CAGR of 7.85% over the period 2011-2015.\nApart from the EHR and consulting business, Accenture witnessed strength in its Outsourcing domain during the third quarter of 2012, which saw the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Moreover, the company is also seeing an expansion in the European market as outsourcing deals increased in the region. Outsourcing business is gradually improving, which is expected to continue in the near future.\nWe are encouraged by the steady flow of new businesses and believe that the trend will continue.

Per the contract, American Electric will support Utilidata for its product development activities. This joint exercise will be held at Utilidata's newly commissioned smart grid simulation and research center in Providence at Rhode Island.\nUtilidata has strong track record in terms of modernizing the delivery of electric energy. Its voltage optimization product called AdaptiVolt solution provides better Volt\/VAR Optimization by using Digital Signal Processing (\"DSP\"), and it has already installed this product in a number of American Electric territories. Volt\/VAR Optimization helps to form reliable energy savings before energy reaches to the customers.\nThis agreement will speed up the utilization of digital control technologies in terms of smart grid solutions and improvement of utility operations, including mixing of distributed generation, offering fault warning and electric vehicles on the distribution systems.\nWe know that American Electric continuously modernize its transmission related infrastructures. Last month, American Electric Power awarded a transmission contract to Quanta Services, Inc. ( PWR ) to reconstruct its 345,000 volt power line of 66 miles located in Corpus Christi at Texas.\nAs a result of the current grid improvement process, American Electric will be able to deliver electricity safely to its customers at a cheaper price and also in a reliable manner. This initiative will also enable the customers to consume electric energy in the future.\nIn addition to developing transmission services, American Electric is also working to improve its generation portfolio by gradually converting coal fired units into natural gas fired units to meet the environmental standards. The company plans to make long-term capital investment in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion to continue its green power development initiatives. We believe that American Electric's steady investment in different types of projects will act as a positive catalyst, particularly as a vital revenue provider in the long run.\nHowever, weak economies in a number of its service states restrict opportunities for American Electric's future growth. In addition, uncertainty related to pending regulatory cases and its predominantly fossil-fuel based generation assets are also matters of concern.\nColumbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power Company Inc. engages in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to retail customers. It generates electricity using coal and lignite, natural gas, nuclear energy and hydroelectric energy.

The new smart meter SoC will provide reliability, accuracy, faster processing power and advanced security for communication protocols.\nA smart meter keeps a record of the power consumed, provides information about usage and helps utility companies for billing purposes.\nMaxim's Zeus is superior because it allows greater precision in the measurement of power within the smart grid and the efficient communication of the information as required. It also takes care of security, which is becoming more of a concern because smart meters are increasingly getting connected.\nIn the present day, there is a growing imbalance between demand and supply of energy, due to a rise in the world population, greater industrialization and depleting natural resources to feed this demand. This is leading to energy efficient structures such as the smart grid. Global energy consumption is expected to reach 20-trillion kilowatt-hours in 2012 and to grow another 10 trillion hours by 2035. Business market researcher marketsandmarkets.com states that the global smart grid market is expected to reach $80.6 billion from $22.8 billion at a CAGR of 28.7% from 2011 to 2016.\nThus, this is a good time for Maxim to build capabilities in the space that could help it tap this immense growth opportunity. Maxim's product portfolio also boasts other smart-meter SoCs like Newport, Metrology SoCs, G3-PLC powerline modem, Secure microcontroller, Power-management controller, 24-bit sigma-delta ADC and the latest being Zeus.\nMaxim is facing competition from other analog makers such as Linear Technology Corp.

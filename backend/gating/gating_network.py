TODO: Gating Network Implementation

This module implements a dynamic gating network that adjusts expert weights based on market conditions.
NOTE: Currently limited by lack of market regime indicators in our dataset.
This module is OPTIONAL and may not be implemented in the initial version.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

1. SIMPLE WEIGHT ADJUSTMENT (Initial Implementation):
   - Use expert confidence scores to adjust weights dynamically
   - Weight experts based on their historical performance
   - Implement simple heuristics for weight adjustment
   - Provide manual weight override capabilities
   - Track expert reliability without external market signals

2. EXPERT PERFORMANCE-BASED WEIGHTING:
   - Track expert accuracy and performance over time
   - Adjust weights based on recent expert success rates
   - Implement rolling performance windows for weight calculation
   - Handle expert failures and reliability degradation
   - Provide performance-based weight recommendations

3. CONFIDENCE-BASED WEIGHTING:
   - Use expert confidence scores to influence weights
   - Higher confidence experts get higher weights
   - Implement confidence thresholds and minimum weights
   - Handle low-confidence scenarios and uncertainty
   - Provide confidence-weighted aggregation strategies

4. BASIC MARKET CONDITION DETECTION (Limited):
   - Use available data to infer basic market conditions
   - Price volatility from OHLCV data
   - News sentiment trends from sentiment expert
   - Simple trend detection from technical indicators
   - Basic regime classification using available signals

5. WEIGHT SMOOTHING AND STABILITY:
   - Implement weight smoothing to prevent rapid fluctuations
   - Apply moving averages and trend filters
   - Handle weight transition periods gracefully
   - Prevent excessive weight changes in short timeframes
   - Maintain system stability during weight adjustments

6. PERFORMANCE TRACKING:
   - Track weight effectiveness and expert performance
   - Monitor expert contribution and weight impact
   - Analyze weight patterns and decision quality
   - Provide weight optimization recommendations
   - Support weight tuning and improvement

7. CONFIGURATION AND FLEXIBILITY:
   - Support configurable weight adjustment parameters
   - Allow manual weight overrides and adjustments
   - Provide weight adjustment confidence thresholds
   - Support different weighting strategies
   - Enable weight-specific parameter tuning

8. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (When Market Data Available):
   - Market regime detection with external indicators
   - VIX and volatility-based weighting
   - Sector rotation and macro regime identification
   - Advanced ML-based regime classification
   - External market signal integration

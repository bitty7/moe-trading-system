TODO: Daily Inference Runner Implementation

This module provides a simple, high-level interface for running daily inference.
It's a lightweight wrapper that calls the backtester with default configurations.
Think of it as a "main()" function or entry point for the system.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

1. SIMPLE INTERFACE AND CONFIGURATION:
   - Provide easy-to-use interface for running backtests
   - Load configuration from environment variables or config files
   - Set up default parameters and settings
   - Handle command-line arguments and user input
   - Provide simple progress reporting and status updates

2. BACKTESTER INTEGRATION:
   - Initialize and configure the backtester component
   - Pass configuration parameters to backtester
   - Handle backtester execution and results
   - Provide simple error handling and user feedback
   - Format and display results in user-friendly way
   - Stream real-time portfolio and ticker metric updates
   - Provide progress updates and metric snapshots
   - Handle GUI callbacks for real-time updates
   - Separate portfolio-level and ticker-level metric streams

3. BASIC WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION:
   - Coordinate the high-level workflow steps
   - Handle basic error scenarios and user input validation
   - Provide simple logging and progress tracking
   - Manage basic system initialization and cleanup
   - Support simple configuration overrides

4. USER INTERFACE AND REPORTING:
   - Display progress and status information
   - Format results for user consumption
   - Provide basic error messages and help text
   - Support simple output formats (console, basic files)
   - Handle user interaction and input validation

EXAMPLE USAGE:
    # Simple command-line usage
    python run_daily_inference.py --start-date 2008-01-01 --end-date 2022-12-31
    
    # Or as a module with real-time updates
    from inference.run_daily_inference import run_backtest_with_updates
    
    def metric_callback(date, portfolio_metrics, ticker_metrics):
        # GUI update function for both levels
        print(f"Date: {date}")
        print(f"Portfolio Return: {portfolio_metrics['total_return']:.2%}")
        print(f"Best Ticker: {ticker_metrics['best_performer']}")
    
    results = run_backtest_with_updates(
        start_date="2008-01-01",
        end_date="2022-12-31",
        tickers=["AA", "AAAU", "AACG"],
        metric_callback=metric_callback
    )
    
    # Get final results and metrics history
    final_portfolio_metrics = results["final_portfolio_metrics"]
    final_ticker_metrics = results["final_ticker_metrics"]
    portfolio_history = results["portfolio_metrics_history"]
    ticker_history = results["ticker_metrics_history"]
"""

RESPONSIBILITIES:

1. BACKTESTING ORCHESTRATION:
   - Initialize backtesting environment and configuration
   - Set up data loaders, experts, aggregator, and evaluation components
   - Manage the main backtesting loop over historical date range
   - Coordinate all system components for each trading day
   - Handle the complete workflow from data loading to decision execution

2. DAILY INFERENCE WORKFLOW:
   - For each date in the backtest range:
     * Load data from all modalities (news, charts, fundamentals, prices)
     * Run all four experts with their respective data
     * Aggregate expert outputs into final trading decision
     * Execute trading decision in portfolio simulator
     * Record results and update portfolio state
     * Log all activities and performance metrics

3. DATA COORDINATION AND ALIGNMENT:
   - Ensure data availability across all modalities for each date
   - Handle missing data entries within files gracefully
   - Align dates across different data sources
   - Validate data quality and coverage for each trading day
   - Provide data availability reporting and warnings

4. EXPERT EXECUTION MANAGEMENT:
   - Execute all four experts in parallel or sequential mode
   - Handle expert failures and timeouts gracefully
   - Implement fallback strategies for failed experts
   - Monitor expert performance and reliability
   - Track expert execution times and resource usage

5. DECISION EXECUTION AND TRADING:
   - Pass expert outputs to aggregator for final decision
   - Execute trading decisions in portfolio simulator
   - Handle capital constraints and position sizing
   - Apply transaction costs and slippage
   - Manage cash reserves and portfolio constraints

6. PERFORMANCE TRACKING AND LOGGING:
   - Record all trading decisions and portfolio states
   - Track daily performance metrics and returns
   - Log data quality issues and expert failures
   - Generate comprehensive backtesting reports
   - Provide real-time progress monitoring

7. ERROR HANDLING AND ROBUSTNESS:
   - Handle system failures and data inconsistencies
   - Implement graceful degradation for component failures
   - Provide detailed error logging and debugging
   - Ensure backtesting continues despite individual failures
   - Support checkpointing and resume functionality

8. CONFIGURATION AND FLEXIBILITY:
   - Support configurable backtesting parameters
   - Handle different ticker lists and date ranges
   - Support various expert configurations and weights
   - Enable different aggregation strategies
   - Provide flexible output and reporting options

EXAMPLE USAGE:
    from inference.run_daily_inference import DailyInferenceRunner
    
    runner = DailyInferenceRunner(
        start_date="2008-01-01",
        end_date="2022-12-31",
        tickers=["AA", "AAAU", "AACG"],
        initial_capital=100000,
        position_sizing=0.1,
        cash_reserve=0.1
    )
    
    results = runner.run_backtest()
    # Returns: {
    #   "portfolio_history": [...],
    #   "trade_log": [...],
    #   "performance_metrics": {...},
    #   "data_coverage": {...},
    #   "expert_performance": {...}
    # }

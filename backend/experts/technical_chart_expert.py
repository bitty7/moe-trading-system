TODO: Technical Chart Expert Implementation

This expert analyzes candlestick chart images to produce trading signals based on visual pattern recognition.
It processes chart images to identify technical patterns and trends that may indicate trading opportunities.

DATA INPUT:
- Location: /dataset/HS500-samples/SP500_images/<ticker>/
- Format: PNG candlestick chart images
- Coverage: Two images per year per ticker (H1: Jan-Jun, H2: Jul-Dec)
- Structure: <ticker>_<year>_<H1/H2>_candlestick.png

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

1. DATA PROCESSING & IMAGE ANALYSIS:
   - Use load_charts.py to get preprocessed chart images for specific periods
   - Handle sparse chart coverage (only 2 images per year)
   - Process multiple chart periods for trend analysis
   - Prepare images for LLM vision analysis
   - Handle image quality and format variations
   - Process chart data with missing period images

2. LLM INTEGRATION (via Ollama with Vision):
   - Use local LLM with vision capabilities to analyze chart patterns
   - Prompt engineering for chart pattern recognition:
     * Identify major chart patterns (head & shoulders, triangles, flags, etc.)
     * Detect trend direction and strength from visual analysis
     * Recognize support and resistance levels
     * Identify breakout and breakdown patterns
     * Assess chart quality and pattern reliability
   - LLM should output structured chart analysis

3. VISUAL PATTERN RECOGNITION:
   - Analyze candlestick patterns and formations
   - Identify trend lines and channel patterns
   - Detect reversal and continuation patterns
   - Recognize volume patterns and price action
   - Assess overall chart structure and market sentiment

4. MULTI-PERIOD ANALYSIS:
   - Combine analysis from multiple chart periods (H1/H2)
   - Identify trend consistency across periods
   - Detect pattern evolution and changes
   - Consider historical context from previous periods
   - Weight recent patterns more heavily than older ones

5. SIGNAL GENERATION:
   - Convert visual chart analysis into [p_buy, p_hold, p_sell] probabilities
   - Weight different patterns based on reliability and strength
   - Consider pattern confirmation and failure rates
   - Handle conflicting visual signals
   - Factor in pattern completion and breakout potential

6. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   - Return: [p_buy, p_hold, p_sell] probability distribution
   - Confidence score for the chart analysis
   - Key chart patterns that influenced the decision
   - Trend direction and strength assessment
   - Pattern completion status and price targets

7. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Handle missing chart images for specific periods
   - Graceful degradation when chart data is sparse
   - Log warnings for image quality issues
   - Fallback to neutral (hold) signal when insufficient data
   - Handle LLM vision failures or timeouts
   - Track chart data availability and missing periods
   - Provide confidence scores based on chart coverage
   - Handle extended periods without chart updates

8. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Cache chart analysis results
   - Optimize image processing for large datasets
   - Batch process multiple chart periods efficiently
   - Optimize LLM vision prompts for faster inference
   - Consider using pre-computed chart embeddings for speed

9. INTEGRATION POINTS:
   - Interface with load_charts.py for data loading
   - Use date_utils.py for date handling
   - Follow common expert interface pattern
   - Log decisions for evaluation and debugging

EXAMPLE USAGE:
    expert = TechnicalChartExpert()
    signal = expert.analyze(ticker="AA", date="2022-01-15")
    # Returns: {"probabilities": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2], "confidence": 0.7, "patterns": ["uptrend", "support"], "periods_analyzed": 3}

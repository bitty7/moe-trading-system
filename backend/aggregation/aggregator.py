TODO: Expert Aggregator Implementation

This module combines outputs from all four experts into a final trading decision.
It implements the aggregation strategy for the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

1. EXPERT OUTPUT COLLECTION:
   - Collect outputs from all four experts for a given date/ticker
   - Validate expert output formats and data quality
   - Handle missing or failed expert outputs gracefully
   - Ensure all experts provide [p_buy, p_hold, p_sell] probabilities
   - Track expert availability and reliability

2. WEIGHTED AGGREGATION STRATEGY:
   - Implement simple weighted aggregation (initially uniform weights)
   - Calculate: final_score = w1*sentiment + w2*timeseries + w3*chart + w4*fundamental
   - Default weights: w1 = w2 = w3 = w4 = 0.25 (uniform)
   - Support configurable weight adjustments
   - Handle expert confidence scores in aggregation

3. DECISION GENERATION:
   - Convert aggregated scores to final [p_buy, p_hold, p_sell] probabilities
   - Apply argmax to determine final decision (Buy/Hold/Sell)
   - Calculate overall confidence score for the decision
   - Handle tie-breaking scenarios and edge cases
   - Provide decision reasoning and expert contributions

4. EXPERT RELIABILITY AND WEIGHTING:
   - Track expert performance and reliability over time
   - Adjust weights based on expert confidence scores
   - Handle expert failures and fallback strategies
   - Implement dynamic weighting based on market conditions
   - Consider expert specialization for different market regimes

5. CONFIDENCE SCORING:
   - Calculate overall confidence based on expert agreement
   - Weight confidence by expert reliability and data quality
   - Handle low-confidence scenarios and uncertainty
   - Provide confidence thresholds for decision execution
   - Track confidence trends over time

6. AGGREGATION MODES:
   - Simple weighted average (current implementation)
   - Attention-based aggregation (future enhancement)
   - Conditional weighting based on market conditions
   - Ensemble methods and voting mechanisms
   - Support for different aggregation strategies

7. ERROR HANDLING AND ROBUSTNESS:
   - Handle missing expert outputs gracefully
   - Implement fallback strategies for expert failures
   - Validate aggregated results and decision quality
   - Handle edge cases and extreme probability distributions
   - Provide detailed error logging and debugging

8. PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
   - Track aggregation performance and decision accuracy
   - Monitor expert contribution and weight effectiveness
   - Analyze decision patterns and expert agreement
   - Provide aggregation analytics and insights
   - Support performance optimization and tuning

EXAMPLE USAGE:
    from aggregation.aggregator import ExpertAggregator
    
    aggregator = ExpertAggregator(weights=[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])
    
    expert_outputs = {
        "sentiment": {"probabilities": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2], "confidence": 0.8},
        "timeseries": {"probabilities": [0.4, 0.4, 0.2], "confidence": 0.7},
        "chart": {"probabilities": [0.2, 0.6, 0.2], "confidence": 0.6},
        "fundamental": {"probabilities": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2], "confidence": 0.9}
    }
    
    final_decision = aggregator.aggregate(expert_outputs)
    # Returns: {
    #   "decision": "HOLD",
    #   "probabilities": [0.3, 0.5, 0.2],
    #   "confidence": 0.75,
    #   "reasoning": "Mixed signals with slight hold bias"
    # }
